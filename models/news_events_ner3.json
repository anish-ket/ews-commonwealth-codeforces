In Srivaikuntam in Thoothukudi district, a student travelling in a bus was waylaid and attacked. Such incidents cause worry about where our society is heading to. Even in this incident, there seems to have been some animosity arising out of an issue over a pencil. The student should have moved on.

This trend should be corrected,\u201d he said.\n\nSchools should be a place to impart education and discipline, he added."

According to Bloomberg, this rebound makes India the first major market globally to erase losses stemming from the reciprocal tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump earlier this month.While a broader index of Asian stocks remains down over 3% since the tariff announcements, India\u2019s swift recovery has underscored its growing perception as a relative safe haven amid ongoing global market volatility , as per the Bloomberg report.Investors continue to view India\u2019s large domestic-driven economy as better equipped to weather a potential global slowdown compared to peers more directly exposed to US tariffs. The escalating US-China trade war has further positioned India as an attractive alternative for global manufacturing, with India maintaining a conciliatory approach and working toward a provisional trade agreement with Washington, in contrast to Beijing\u2019s retaliatory stance.ALSO READ: Indian and American trade delegations to begin discussions on a bilateral trade agreement this week \u201cWe remain overweight India in our portfolios,\u201d said Gary Dugan, CEO of The Global CIO Office. \u201cSupported by good domestic growth and aided by a likely diversification of supply chains away from China, Indian equities are seen as a safer bet over the medium term,\u201d he told Bloomberg.India\u2019s sharp rebound follows a nearly 10% slump in the Nifty 50 over the past two quarters, triggered by slowing economic growth, steep valuations, and continued foreign investor outflows. So far this year, overseas investors have sold more than $16 billion in Indian equities on a net basis, close to the record $17 billion withdrawn in 2022.ALSO READ | Sensex, Nifty surge over 2%: 5 reasons behind market rally Still, improving investor sentiment is being supported by relatively lower stock valuations, expectations of aggressive rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India, and declining crude oil prices \u2014 a major positive for India\u2019s import-heavy economy.As per Bloomberg data, the Nifty 50 is currently trading at 18.5 times its projected 12-month earnings, compared to a five-year average of 19.5 and a peak multiple of 21 in late September.\u201cIndia is not insulated, but relatively better positioned amid the risk of a trade war given its low direct revenue exposure to US, particularly on the goods side,\u201d said Rajat Agarwal, strategist at Societe Generale SA. \u201cIndian equities should also benefit if oil prices sustain at low levels.\u201dData compiled by Bloomberg shows India accounted for just 2.7% of total US imports last year, far lower than China\u2019s 14% and Mexico\u2019s 15%."

Each flight can carry around 88,000 kg of cargo.\n\nIn response to queries by The Business Times about launching a new US-Singapore air cargo link when blanket tariffs on all imports to the US were recently announced, Preet emphasised the strategic aspect of the new route.\n\n\u201cWith the current uncertainties in the global trade outlook, naturally, businesses focused on exports may take a more cautious approach in the short-to-medium term.

Together, we\u2019re #WorkingForSingapore.\u201d\n\nThe video featured all eight of the party\u2019s elected MPs \u2013 Aljunied GRC MPs Pritam Singh, Sylvia Lim, Faisal Manap and Gerald Giam; Hougang MP Dennis Tan; and Sengkang GRC MPs Louis Chua, He Ting Ru and Jamus Lim.\n\nIn the video, Giam said it is important to have balance in the political system. \u201cWe cannot have one party that\u2019s dominating everything in Singapore. There needs to be more diversity,\u201d he said.\n\nAssociate Professor Lim said the only way that successful new ideas can come to fruition is through a contest. \u201cThat\u2019s necessary and healthy for any mature democracy,\u201d he added.\n\nLim added: \u201cIf the PAP fails, what\u2019s our Plan B?\u201d\n\nBefore the video ended with the \u2018Working For Singapore\u2019 tagline, Singh called Singaporeans the \u201ctrue agents of change\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Workers\u2019 Party is just the platform to bring their voices into Parliament, and the true people who have power are the voters. And they control the future,\u201d he said.\n\nWP is the most successful opposition party in Singapore to date. Its candidates in the 2020 general election clinched 10 seats in Parliament after winning two group representation constituencies \u2013 Aljunied and Sengkang \u2013 and the single-member constituency of Hougang.\n\nIts secretary-general Pritam Singh was designated Leader of the Opposition after the 2020 polls, making him the first opposition leader to formally hold such an office. The post granted Singh the right of first response among MPs, more time to speak in Parliament, staff support and resources to carry out the role, double the allowance of an elected MP, and office space at Parliament House.\n\nUp till the writ\u2019s release, WP has heavily guarded its election plans, including the constituencies it would contest and its slate. The party was only explicit about its medium-term goal to win one-third of the seats in Parliament.\n\nBased on observations at walkabouts and party sources, The Straits Times gathered that the WP is likely to field a bumper crop of at least 30 candidates in eight constituencies this time round.\n\nThese are: Aljunied, Sengkang, Punggol, East Coast, Marine Parade-Braddell Heights and Tampines GRCs, and the single seats of Hougang and Tampines Changkat.\n\nThis would be the WP\u2019s largest showing in an election yet - the party contested 23 seats in 2011, 28 seats in 2015, and 21 seats in 2020.\n\nST also estimated that at least 17 of the WP\u2019s 2025 slate are expected to be new faces, many of them professionals, including lawyers and management consultants. This would surpass the record 16 newcomers in 2011 and 2015, and almost double the nine fielded in 2020.\n\nAmong the 13 new faces that ST has identified are Dr Ong Lue Ping, 47, who was IMH\u2019s director of allied health from 2022 to 2024, Michael Thng, 37, a master\u2019s graduate from Harvard Kennedy School, and Kenneth Tiong, 36, the former head quant developer of Brahman Capital.

PHOTO: JASPER YU\n\nYoung entrepreneurs talk about going beyond grades and pay at ST Podcast Live event\n\nSINGAPORE \u2013 As a young boy, Mr Nabill Shukry Johari, 27, always saw entrepreneurship as a way out of poverty \u2013 and he has proven himself right.\n\nNow in his final semester as a part-time marketing student at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, he runs two businesses: Cheekies, a meal prep company supplying five food and beverage outlets, and Cheeky Media, a creative agency that helps brands thrive on TikTok Shop.\n\nHe said: \u201cThrough this entrepreneurship route, I\u2019m able to save a lot of money and pay for my mother\u2019s medical expenses. And when we go out for dinner, we don\u2019t have to think about the bill. I can just treat my parents to a good dinner.\u201d\n\nIn the second edition of ST Podcasts Live, Mr Nabill was joined by Ms Adella Yeo Rae-Nyse, 27, a fellow entrepreneur and co-founder of career-matching platform MatcHub.\n\nExplaining why she turned her back on a nine-to-five job, Ms Yeo said: \u201cBack then, our parents\u2019 definition of success was a good stable job, a good income, and a basic standard of living... But what I really look for is happiness and self-accomplishment.\u201d\n\nThe conversation, part of The Straits Times\u2019 In Your Opinion podcast, was hosted by ST assistant podcast editor Lynda Hong. The full recording will be posted on ST Podcasts\u2019 YouTube, Apple Podcasts and Spotify on April 23.\n\nAbout 100 people attended the live broadcast at indie cinema The Projector at Golden Mile Tower. PHOTO: JASPER YU\n\nAbout 100 people attended two recordings at indie cinema The Projector at Golden Mile Tower.\n\nAt the event, Mr Nabill and Ms Yeo responded to questions about how young people should handle setbacks when they choose to go into business for themselves.\n\nMs Yeo, who now works remotely as an account manager at a software firm, recalled how an internship once left her overwhelmed and demotivated when her manager reprimanded her for not completing a design task well.\n\nHer former school teachers and mentors advised her not to be bogged down by her weaknesses, but to find ways to shine using her strengths. So, she asked her manger to switch her to a client-facing role, and she started to excel.\n\nMs Yeo said: \u201cSeek advice from others, try to change or get out of the (bad) situation and see opportunities.\u201d\n\nSince starting Cheekies in 2021, Mr Nabill has been tempted to throw in the towel many times after facing setbacks \u2013 including when Malaysia stopped supplying chicken to Singapore and local stock was limited.\n\n\u201c(But) that gave me the opportunity to explore other products. After that, I released chicken chop and lamb chop, and they opened me to new markets and more customers,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring Ramadan, when orders dipped as customers did not want to cook, he introduced single portions of ready-to-eat meals.\n\nMr Nabill said: \u201cSetbacks sometimes can be crushing...you have to communicate with people, seek advice and look at things from a bigger perspective.\u201d\n\nThe special In Your Opinion podcast live recording was organised in partnership with the National Youth Council (NYC), in support of the SG Youth Plan \u2013 an action blueprint for how society can listen, support and partner young people.\n\n(From left) In Your Opinion host Lynda Hong with guest speakers Adella Yeo Rae-Nyse and Nabill Shukry Johari, as they take a wefie with the 100-strong audience at the Projector at Golden Mile Tower on April 15.

ST PHOTO: AZMI ATHNI\n\nSINGAPORE - A vision to make the \u201cEast Side Best Side\u201d was unveiled on April 15, with the PAP representatives for East Coast GRC laying out a refreshed slate of promises and plans on a new website.\n\nThe promises were organised around eight pillars \u2013 A Place To Learn, Care, Eat, Pray, Conserve, Play, Shape The Future, and A Place For All \u2013 and can be found on oureastcoast.sg, which went live at noon.\n\nThe website features work completed in the constituency over the past five years, and a road map that looks forward to 2030.\n\nAt a media briefing on April 15, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Edwin Tong said core infrastructure is already in place, so the next phase of the East Coast Plan will centre on residents\u2019 lived experiences.\n\n\u201cNow that we have the baseline of infrastructure, we are going to take off from there and construct a plan moving forward, based on how our residents would like to use the facilities and how they organise themselves and their family,\u201d said Mr Tong.\n\nThe plan is organised around how people live, work and play, not around \u201cpublic shelters or how many footpaths or how many walkways\u201d, he said.\n\nThe East Coast Plan was first introduced during the 2020 General Election by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, the five-member group representation constituency\u2019s anchor minister. He was not present at the briefing.\n\nThe team of five providing the update comprised Mr Tong, Senior Minister of State Tan Kiat How, Deputy Speaker Jessica Tan and PAP new faces Hazlina Abdul Halim and Goh Pei Ming.\n\nOn April 12, Minister in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office Maliki Osman, who was part of the team that stood in East Coast GRC in 2020, said he would not be contesting there in the upcoming election and named Madam Hazlina as his successor.\n\nMadam Hazlina, the former chief executive of Make-A-Wish Singapore, started her career as a radio presenter for Mediacorp\u2019s Ria 89.7FM.\n\nShe later transitioned into television, and was at one point an assignments editor on CNA\u2019s Singapore desk.\n\nMr Goh was Singapore Armed Forces chief of staff \u2013 joint staff.\n\nThe refreshed East Coast Plan for the next five years aims to equip residents with opportunities to learn and grow. It covers programmes such as digital inclusion for seniors, youth leadership, mental wellness and support for caregivers.\n\nPreserving hawker culture and fostering interfaith harmony are central themes, alongside efforts to create inclusive public spaces and support for pet owners, families and lower-income households.\n\nEnvironmental sustainability \u2013 such as expanded green spaces, electric vehicle charging points and community-led conservation initiatives \u2013 also features in the plan.\n\nIt also outlines planned infrastructure improvements in the area, such as the upgrading of Tanah Merah MRT station, new Build-To-Order projects in Simei, revamping Kampong Chai Chee Community Club into a community hub and the construction of Safra Bayshore.\n\n\u201cWe thought to create a plan that was not centred on hardware facilities, but on the way in which our residents saw these facilities as improving their lives,\u201d said Mr Tong.\n\nJoin ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads."

PHOTO: ST FILE\n\nOpposition parties ramp up election preparations, as some criticise date of Polling Day\n\nSINGAPORE - The various opposition parties will ramp up efforts to win over voters, as some expressed concerns over the short runway to the general election.\n\nParliament was dissolved on April 15, with Nomination Day on April 23. Singaporeans will head to the polls on May 3 to elect 97 MPs across 33 constituencies.\n\nThe various opposition parties put out statements after the Writ of Election was issued.\n\nSingapore Democratic Party (SDP)\n\nThe SDP criticised the \u201cimpossibly short\u201d timeline between the release of the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee (EBRC) report for the 2025 General Election and the dissolution of Parliament.\n\nThe report on the new electoral boundaries was released on March 11, 35 days before Parliament was dissolved.\n\nIn 2020, the EBRC report was published on March 13 that year with the Writ issued three months later on June 23.\n\nIn 2015, there was a month\u2019s gap between the release of the report and the issuance of the Writ.\n\nSDP, which plans to contest Sembawang GRC, Sembawang West SMC, Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC and Holland-Bukit Timah GRC, said Singaporeans need the time to thoroughly examine issues like the cost of living before casting their votes.\n\n\u201cElections are solemn exercises where the people are given ample time to become thoroughly familiar with the parties, their platforms and candidates so that they can make informed decisions at the polls,\u201d the statement said.\n\nHowever, with the short amount of time left, Singaporeans have been denied \u201cthis crucial opportunity\u201d, the party said.\n\nRed Dot United (RDU)\n\nMr Ravi Philemon, secretary-general of the RDU, said opposition parties now have just over two weeks to organise themselves for \u201ca defining election\u201d .\n\nHe also questioned why Nomination Day was taking place on April 23. Having it on April 22 instead would allow Cooling-off Day to be on May 1 \u2013 Labour Day \u2013 and Polling Day on May 2.\n\n\u201cInstead, this election has been timed so that Labour Day will be followed immediately by Cooling-off Day \u2013 a day when all political parties are legally barred from speaking,\u201d he said .\n\nThe opposition parties will not be able to respond to statements put out by the ruling party during the May Day Rally, Mr Philemon said.\n\nHe added that RDU has been preparing since 2020 and is ready for the election.\n\nThe party\u2019s candidates will be revealed in the lead-up to Nomination Day, he said, adding that RDU will remain focused on championing issues that residents face such as cost of living, jobs and quality of life.\n\nRDU has thus far introduced its team leads for Nee Soon GRC, Holland-Bukit Timah GRC, Jurong East-Bukit Batok GRC and Jurong Central SMC .\n\nPeople\u2019s Power Party (PPP)\n\nThe PPP said it was deeply disappointed that the PAP had called an election \u201cwithout allowing sufficient time\u201d between the issuance of the Writ of Election and Nomination Day.\n\nIt said the timeline appeared to be a move to capitalise on the fear stoked by US President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs.\n\nThe party said there are urgent national issues demanding attention, such as the rising cost of living, job insecurity, overpopulation, and a persistent lack of effective checks and balances in the system.\n\nThus far, the PPP has signalled its intentions to contest Tampines GRC and Ang Mo Kio GRC.\n\nSingapore Democratic Alliance (SDA)\n\nMr Desmond Lim, chairman of the SDA, which will contest Pasir Ris-Changi GRC, says his party is ready for the election.\n\n\u201cWe are in operational readiness (mode). We\u2019re just like soldiers on reservist,\u201d he said .\n\nHis team has already printed 50,000 campaign fliers and 2,000 campaign posters.\n\nThe party currently has about 200 volunteers ready to act as polling and counting agents, and held training sessions at its headquarters in Changi Road on the night of April 15 .\n\nMr Lim said that instead of holding a physical rally, which may \u201cinconvenience the elderly\u201d, the party will conduct one online, having started to record the materials this week.\n\nNational Solidarity Party (NSP)\n\nSecretary-general Spencer Ng told The Straits Times that the party was unsurprised by the date .\n\n\u201cThis is detrimental to the spirit of democracy, but nonetheless, the opposition parties have to play by the rules set by the PAP and be ready as best we can.\u201d\n\nCurrently, the party is planning to ramp up its campaign, having filled up its slots for volunteers in the constituencies it has laid claim to.\n\nThese comprise Sembawang GRC, Sembawang West SMC, Tampines GRC, Tampines Changkat SMC and possibly Jalan Besar GRC .\n\nSingapore People\u2019s Party (SPP)\n\nSPP said in a statement that the upcoming election represents a pivotal moment in Singapore\u2019s political landscape, being the first under Prime Minister Lawrence Wong and the Republic\u2019s fourth-generation leadership team.\n\n\u201cThe SPP views this as an opportunity for Singaporeans to voice their concerns, aspirations and frustrations, so as to shape the future direction of our country,\u201d it said.\n\nSecretary-general Steve Chia has called for people to step up as volunteers, urging them to \u201ccome together and make a meaningful difference\u201d.\n\nSPP added that it is committed to \u201cparticipating actively in this democratic process\u201d with five candidates standing in Potong Pasir SMC and Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC.\n\n\u201cOur focus will be on addressing the pressing concerns of Singaporeans, including the rising cost of living, income inequality, and the need for more inclusive policies that cater to all segments of society,\u201d the party said.\n\nSingapore United Party (SUP)\n\nMr Andy Zhu, secretary-general of SUP, which is contesting Ang Mo Kio GRC, said the election is an opportunity for residents to shape the future of Singapore .\n\nIn the coming days, SUP will be increasing the frequency of its outreach and coordinating its proposers, seconders and assenters.\n\nIt is also waiting for the completion and delivery of its election posters and fliers by Nomination Day when it will announce its slate of candidates .\n\nPeople\u2019s Alliance for Reform (PAR)\n\nMr Lim Tean, the secretary-general of PAR \u2013 an alliance of three parties \u2013 said in a Facebook post that it welcomes the calling of the general election.\n\nThe alliance is looking to contest the single-seat wards of Potong Pasir, Mountbatten, Radin Mas, Queenstown and Yio Chu Kang, as well as Jalan Besar GRC and Tanjong Pagar GRC.\n\nIn a video, he said the PAR has been waiting and preparing for the election for a \u201cvery long time\u201d.\n\nAdditional reporting by Lee Li Ying, Michelle Ng, Harith Mustaffa, Samuel Devaraj, Chin Soo Fang, and Gabrielle Chan\n\nJoin ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads."

                "content": "The complementary roles of the public service and political leadership, coupled with a sense of common purpose, is what takes Singapore forward, said DPM Heng Swee Keat. PHOTO: LIANHE ZAOBAO\n\nSINGAPORE - With political contestation here becoming more intense, some political parties have taken to claiming that Singaporeans need not fear a change of government, given the country\u2019s first-class public service.\n\nSuch rhetoric is alarming, given that the political leadership and the public service pursue a common purpose but play different roles, said Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat.\n\nSpeaking at the annual Administrative Service dinner on April 15, DPM Heng said he is convinced that no minister could make effective policies for the long-term interest of Singapore if he focused only on political engagements, and left policy design to the public service.\n\n\u201cIf the political leaders I had served in my Admin Service days had done that, and had no policy instincts on what makes Singapore tick, I would have left the public service long ago and so would many of my fellow permanent secretaries,\u201d he told the 320 guests at the dinner at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre.\n\n\u201cWe stayed in service because the political leaders we worked with share the same mission of creating a better future for Singapore, for Singaporeans, and with clear strategic minds.\u201d\n\nRecounting his own experience as permanent secretary under then Minister for Trade and Industry George Yeo, DPM Heng said it was Mr Yeo who set the strategic direction of pursuing free trade agreements (FTAs) and to persuade fellow ministers in other countries on the value of FTAs, while he supervised the details of Singapore\u2019s negotiations.\n\nWhen he later became a political leader, the permanent secretaries who reported to him \u2013 including at the Ministry of Education and the National Research Foundation \u2013 were not afraid to have open and rigorous policy debates.\n\n\u201cTill today, I am very heartened that our educators and Admin Service officers would tell me honestly if my idea was flawed,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had the courage to speak truth to power.\u201d\n\nThe complementary roles of the public service and political leadership, coupled with a sense of common purpose, is what takes Singapore forward, said DPM Heng.\n\nBesides the importance of trust between the public service and the political leadership, DPM Heng shared five other lessons for Administrative Service officers at the dinner.\n\nRespect and develop the front line\n\nDPM Heng recounted an incident from the earliest days of his career, when, as a police patrol officer, he had to direct traffic at a busy junction as the traffic light had broken down.\n\nDespite holding the rank of assistant superintendent and being able to write essays about the global economy, he was \u201ccompletely incompetent\u201d at directing traffic, and it was his teammate, a police constable, who managed to restore order.\n\n\u201cIt was a humbling experience, but I learnt an important lesson: Serving our citizens starts with the front-line officer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe front-line officer is the contact point, the interface, between our policies and programmes and their impact on citizens.\u201d\n\nWhile administrative officers do complex modelling and analysis as they design policies, DPM Heng urged them to understand how policies are perceived by and transmitted to citizens.\n\n\u201cThe front-line officer, the interface between policy intent and outcome, is where the rubber hits the road, where execution happens,\u201d he said. \u201cExecution is policy. So do your best, respect and develop the front line, and spend some time at the front line.\u201d\n\nHave the courage to experiment\n\nAmong a leader\u2019s most critical tasks is to set strategic direction, and to be willing to change direction when the situation demands it, said DPM Heng.\n\nHe cited examples of how past police commissioners such as Mr Goh Yong Hong and Mr Tee Tua Ba understood how the challenges of policing had evolved through the decades, and were willing to make paradigm shifts in their approaches.\n\nFor instance, Mr Goh observed that secret societies in the 1980s were more street gangs of listless youth, and not the hardened, organised triads of old. To help them expend their youthful energy, he started the Police Boys Club and held rock concerts in the middle of Orchard Road.\n\nDespite initial resistance to the idea from some senior police officers, the concerts went well and the police built new relationships with young people, said DPM Heng.\n\n\u201cA lesson for all officers is that we should not be slaves to our past. Use the experiences of the past. When the situation changes, be prepared to be bold, to have the courage to experiment, to innovate, and to make a paradigm shift.\u201d\n\nTurn constraints into opportunity\n\nThe Singapore story is one of turning constraints into opportunity, said DPM Heng.\n\nFor instance, its small domestic market forced the country to always look outwards. By welcoming the world\u2019s best multinational enterprises, Singapore leapfrogged the region and became a First World country, he said.\n\n\u201cBy not adopting a narrow approach of protecting our local companies, it forced our companies to compete, to upgrade,\u201d he added.\n\nHe noted that Singapore has not been spared the tariffs imposed by the US on its trading partners, but the Republic must build on its 27 bilateral and regional free trade agreements to emerge stronger from this turbulence.\n\nDPM Heng said that as countries and companies significantly reconfigure the global supply chain to consider not just efficiency but also reliability, Singapore, as a major trade hub and logistics centre, can play a trusted role in this process.\n\n\u201cIn this age of trade and tech war, let us position Singapore to be a global-Asia node of technology, innovation and enterprise \u2013 trusted, relevant and useful to the world,\u201d he said.\n\nThink long term, embrace contradictions\n\nAs finance minister during the Covid-19 pandemic, DPM Heng went to then President Halimah Yacob five times in 2020 to brief her on each of that year\u2019s five government Budgets, and to seek her approval to use past reserves.\n\nIn the end, the Government used some $40 billion of past reserves to protect Singaporean lives and livelihoods.\n\n\u201cWhile all finance ministers around the world supported their economies and peoples during the pandemic, I am probably the only one who allocated such a big sum without having to borrow a cent,\u201d he said.\n\nToday\u2019s Singaporeans have benefited from the legacy of long-term stewardship by its founding leaders, and current and future generations and leaders should likewise treasure and preserve this legacy, he added.\n\nDPM Heng also urged officers to embrace apparent contradictions in their policymaking. For instance, the Monetary Authority of Singapore has a dual mandate to develop the financial sector here while keeping it safe and stable.\n\nThis appears to be contradictory, but forces the authority to weigh the risks and returns of what it does, DPM Heng said.\n\n\u201cSingapore must create our distinctive competitive advantage, and this ambidexterity in our regulatory agencies can be a source of strength, especially in sectors where trust and confidence is critical,\u201d he added.\n\nEngage Singaporeans in decision-making\n\nSingaporeans today are better educated, better informed, and more keen to take part in decision-making, and this is a strength for the country, he said.\n\nThe public service must harness this creativity and energy and encourage active participation in nation-building, or risk a divided or apathetic society, said DPM Heng.\n\nHe noted that Prime Minister Lawrence Wong had launched the Forward Singapore movement to hear the views of citizens, and to co-create solutions to strengthen Singapore\u2019s social compact.\n\nHe encouraged Administrative Service officers to widen their engagement not just within their ministries, but also to the whole of society.\n\nRetirement of five permanent secretaries\n\nAt the dinner, Head of Civil Service Leo Yip paid tribute to five permanent secretaries who have retired or are retiring.\n\nThey are Permanent Secretary for Policy at the Ministry of Trade and Industry Gabriel Lim, who retired in September 2024; Permanent Secretary for Health Chan Yeng Kit, who retired in January; Permanent Secretary for National Development Ow Foong Pheng and Second Permanent Secretary for Trade and Industry and Manpower Jeffrey Siow, who both retired earlier in April; and Permanent Secretary for Finance Tan Ching Yee, who will be retiring in May.\n\nMr Yip said the public service is undergoing its own leadership renewal in tandem with political leadership renewal, with several permanent secretaries, deputy secretaries, chief executives and other senior public service leaders retiring in recent years.\n\nWith the world changing drastically, he said, the public service has to always be prepared for new shocks and disruptions, and at a higher cadence than before.\n\n\u201cWe do so by strengthening our resilience, as a system, so that we can organise ourselves quickly, respond nimbly, and recover strongly from any shock,\u201d said Mr Yip.\n\n\u201cAnd we sustain and strengthen our system of governance by effecting leadership renewal, enabling each successive generation of leaders to succeed and keep Singapore thriving.\u201d\n\nJoin ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads."

CAUT will continue to provide updates as developments occur,\u201d a supplemental notice in the advisory said.\n\n\u201cIn the interim, the CAUT strongly recommends that members considering travel to the U.S. review options for remote attendance and travel only if necessary.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIt goes on to note: \u201cIssues with respect to travel to the U.S. extend beyond inspection and search of electronic devices, given Presidential Executive Orders and the apparent application of a heightened ethnic and religious screening process by CBP officers.\u201d\n\nLast month, a French scientist was denied entry into the U.S., allegedly for expressing a personal opinion on the Trump administration\u2019s research policy, the French education ministry said at the time.\n\nA spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Border Protection said privacy restrictions barred the agency from discussing specific cases, adding that all people arriving in the country are subject to inspection on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThat warning comes nearly two weeks after the federal government updated its travel advisory for the U.S., saying Canadians should \u201cexpect scrutiny\u201d when crossing ports of entry and the search of their electronic devices.\n\nThe government also warned that Canadians who are denied entry could be detained while awaiting deportation back to Canada."

Sign Up Sign Up\n\nThe most common response, chosen by about six in 10, was to raise prices and pass the additional costs on to US consumers. The next most common response was to seek export markets beyond the US.\n\nAmong US companies surveyed, most indicated no intention to reshore manufacturing or alter existing supply chains.\n\n\u201cWhat this tells us is that the US is still likely to maintain the current status quo \u2013 continuing to buy from the Asean region and China to the extent that it can,\u201d said Parisha.\n\nBoth she and fellow panellist Richard Burn, a senior counsellor for global advisory firm APCO, agreed that in the medium term, regional exporters should look to diversify.\n\nShe advised Asean-based businesses to seek non-US export markets, warning of a potentially longer-term shift in global trade policy.\n\nAsean countries should see this as a strategic opportunity to leverage the region\u2019s consumer base \u2013 which accounts for 40 per cent of global growth \u2013 to reduce their exposure to the US market, she added.\n\nBurn noted that China has been diversifying its export markets beyond the US \u2013 including to Asean \u2013 and this effort is \u201cnow intensifying\u201d.\n\nLoss of goodwill\n\nAt Monday\u2019s Iseas webinar, participants noted that while Singapore faces only the baseline 10 per cent tariff, the greater concern is how politicised and unpredictable trade actions are reshaping the global system.\n\nVisiting senior fellow Jayant Menon said that Singapore \u201chas recognised the need to take a strong position\u201d because \u201cthis may not be the end of the onslaught\u201d from Washington.\n\n\u201cEverything you hear now might change in an hour or a day,\u201d he said.\n\nDr Deborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation in Singapore, noted how tariffs on electronics were unexpectedly lifted on Friday, only to be reinstated by Sunday under a new semiconductor category.\n\nSuch instability dents business confidence, said Dr Luna Ge Lai, a research fellow at the Institute for International Affairs at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\n\nShe noted that the tariffs have prompted many multinational corporations to hold back on decisions.\n\nProfessor Hal Hill, emeritus professor of economics at the Australian National University, criticised the Trump administration\u2019s zero-sum approach to trade, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re doing deals a la real estate, not what\u2019s in the best interests of the global economy.\u201d"

ST PHOTO: KUA CHEE SIONG\n\nSINGAPORE - Candidates contesting this year\u2019s general election will need to pay $13,500 each \u2013 the same as in the 2020 election.\n\nThis and other details were revealed on April 15 by the Elections Department (ELD) shortly after President Tharman Shanmugaratnam dissolved Parliament and issued the Writ of Election.\n\nPolling Day will be on May 3, a Saturday, if more than one candidate or group of candidates are nominated for an electoral division on Nomination Day. Nomination Day will be on Wednesday, April 23.\n\nCandidates\u2019 election deposits will be forfeited if they are not elected and do not secure more than 12.5 per cent of the votes polled.\n\nThe deposit is set as the fixed monthly allowance payable to an elected MP for the month immediately before the date of dissolution of Parliament, rounded to the nearest $500. The current fixed monthly allowance is $13,750.\n\nCandidates are encouraged to pay their deposits early, and not wait until Nomination Day to do so. Other than using a cheque, electronic payment methods, such as PayNow and bank transfer, are also available.\n\nCandidates are also encouraged to use the digital services at the ELD website to prepare their nomination papers. This helps them check that their proposer, seconder and assenters are from the GRC or SMC the candidates are contesting.\n\nCompleted papers should be printed and signed, and the nomination papers must be delivered in person to the respective nomination centres between 11am and noon on Nomination Day.\n\nThe candidate, or group of candidates, must be accompanied by a proposer, a seconder and at least four assenters when delivering the nomination papers.\n\nEach candidate must also apply for a political donation certificate from the Registrar of Political Donations by April 19. This may also be done online.\n\nCandidates must adhere to election expenses limits stipulated in the Parliamentary Elections Act, which is currently $5 for every elector in their electoral division.\n\nIf a candidate is contesting a group representation constituency , the limit is $5 per elector for that GRC, divided by the number of candidates in the group.\n\nUnder the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act, only Singapore citizens aged 21 and above or Singapore entities are allowed to make political donations, which include gifts, loans and voluntary labour.\n\nFor groups of candidates seeking election in a GRC , a relevant certificate from either the Malay Community Committee or the Indian and Other Minority Communities Committee is required. These applications will close on April 19.\n\nThe chairman of the Malay Community Committee is Mr Mohamed Sa\u2019at Abdul Rahman. The other members are Dr Hadijah Rahmat, Dr Mohamed Ali, Madam Rahayu Mohamad and Mr Zulkifli Baharudin.\n\nThe chairman of the Indian and Other Minority Communities Committee is Associate Professor Narayanan Ganapathy. The other members are Mr Khiatani Manohar Ramesh, Mr Ravinder Singh, Mr Vincent Schoon and Dr Zahabar Ali.\n\nThere will be 18 GRCs and 15 single-member constituencies up for contest, up from the current 17 GRCs and 14 SMCs. The number of elected MPs will increase from the current 93 to 97.\n\nMay 3 will be a public holiday. Every employer should allow their voters a reasonable period of time to vote, said ELD.\n\nThe Ministry of Manpower, in a separate statement, reminded companies that Polling Day should be treated the same as any other public holiday. Employees are entitled to either a day off or salary in lieu, if Polling Day is a non-working day for them, added the ministry.\n\nThe Returning Officer is Mr Han Kok Juan, director-general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, who will oversee the smooth conduct of the election. He took over the role from Housing Board chief executive Tan Meng Dui on April 1.\n\nThe election, Singapore\u2019s 14th since independence, is likely to again see the PAP challenged for all seats \u2013 as was the case in 2020.\n\nJoin ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads."

                "content": "You'd have to squint till your eyeballs ache, but there is a foreseeable scenario where Canada and the U.S. build a closer relationship out of this ugly moment.\n\nThis outcome is far from certain \u2014 hence the squinting.\n\nBut one influential figure in Washington professes to see it. Donald Trump's first-term trade czar predicted the optimistic scenario last week in Ottawa, speaking behind closed doors.\n\n\"Whatever is going on now is not going to last, and it'll be fine,\" Robert Lighthizer told the Canada Strong and Free Network, a conservative think-tank, on a recording shared with CBC News.\n\n\"The relationship between the United States and Canada is going to be as good or better than it has ever been and the business relationship will be fine.\"\n\nThere are three broad potential scenarios after this month's federal election, after which Canada and the U.S. are poised to enter comprehensive trade and security negotiations .\n\nCall them the good place, the bad place and the messy middle.\n\nWATCH | Uncertainty over tariffs: Confusion reigns over Trump\u2019s tariff plans Duration 2:29 U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s plan for tariffs and exemptions didn\u2019t get any clearer over the weekend with officials saying electronics from China will face tariffs in the coming months because of \u2018national security.\u2019\n\nThe good place? Economic security, military security \u2014 Canada gets both, with tariff-free trade restored and the U.S. defence umbrella intact. Canada could even gain new advantages, if the U.S. keeps its tariffs against other countries.\n\nLighthizer hinted at this. He suggested Canada has gained a competitive edge amid the recent trade war as its tariffs are, generally, lower than those on most countries.\n\nMost products traded under the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) have tariff exemptions, and Canada and Mexico did not get the same 10 per cent universal tariff as other countries.\n\n\"My own analysis is that Canada is better off because [CUSMA] is more valuable than it was six weeks ago,\" Lighthizer said.\n\nHe added a caveat. There are still tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum.\n\nHe didn't mention tariffs on another massive industry, the auto sector, which is now caught in a tangle of exemptions and duties \u2014 a Swiss cheese of trade barriers.\n\nWhich brings us to the messy middle.\n\nBleak and bleaker scenarios\n\nIt's the in-between scenario and it looks, frankly, like our present purgatory: a relationship corroded by doubt, eaten away by a tariff here and another one there.\n\n\"I think [CUSMA] is on life support right now. And I think it will be like that for the next year \u2014 at least,\" Mexican economist Jes\u00fas Carrillo told a panel on Monday organized by the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think-tank.\n\nHe predicted the trade pact will survive. Then again, in this messy, uncertain moment, where tariffs shift from day to day, who knows what tomorrow's trade reality will be? Let alone next year's.\n\nJust look at recent appearances by Lighthizer's successor, the current U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.\n\nIn two days of hearings on Capitol Hill last week, he, too, referred to Canada and Mexico enjoying privileged access to the U.S. market, under CUSMA.\n\nWATCH | Car parts could be spared, Trump says: Trump says Canadian car parts among list of possible products spared from U.S. tariffs Duration 6:26 U.S. President Donald Trump announced the possibility of additional tariff exemptions on certain car parts made in Canada following ambiguity around tariffs on electronic imports from China. Trump said on Monday that further tariffs are expected to target pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.\n\nThen again, he also talked about an advantage for the broader Western hemisphere. He said several times that textile production could move closer to home, as Latin American countries mostly had a tariff of 10 per cent, while it was quadruple that in most Asian countries.\n\nBut his testimony was obsolete by the time he left the U.S. Capitol. While Greer was still on the witness stand, Trump eliminated that tariff differential, giving almost every country on Earth the same 10 per cent rate.\n\nAnd that's the messy middle. Our current unstable trading system, being scrambled from one minute to the next by an unpredictable U.S. president, with tariffs on certain products but not others; and it changes day to day.\n\nAs Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon said, his voice rising: \"What. Is. The. Plan? In the last week the White House has been all over the map.\"\n\nIt could be worse. It could be a full-blown, ever-escalating crisis \u2014 the bad place. We already got glimpses of that between December and March.\n\nThe U.S. is unhappy with Canada's digital services tax and its supply-management system for dairy, eggs and poultry. (Shane Hennessey/CBC)\n\nFor about three months, Trump kept threatening Canada's economic and national survival, talking about immiserating it so severely it might plead to join the U.S.\n\nHe's recently stopped talking about crushing Canada's economy, or forcing it to accept U.S. annexation, or referring to the prime minister as \"governor.\"\n\nWe'll know soon whether he intends to resume this, after this month's federal election, when it will become clear whether Trump has changed his tune or has been biting his tongue for fear of influencing the vote.\n\nImpediments to a quick deal\n\nIn any case, it will take time to rebuild trust, says one Washington analyst. She likens the process to therapy \u2014 Canada and the U.S. will, first, need to air their grievances.\n\n\"Right now things are very hot, and we need to give it some time to cool down so that there can be a reset,\" said Jamie Tronnes, executive director of the Center for North American Prosperity and Security.\n\n\"Canada and the U.S. need some time to be able to come to the table and talk about the problems that we've had in the relationship.\"\n\nThe U.S. has longstanding complaints about Canada's failure to meet its defence commitments, from the Arctic to military spending, she noted. Canada, meanwhile, has been angered by these tariffs.\n\nSeveral other factors could drag this out.\n\nFor example, it might take over a year just to start reviewing the CUSMA, if the U.S. follows its own legal processes for the renegotiation. In theory, the U.S. could scale back tariffs while negotiating.\n\n\"The mechanisms to change [CUSMA] are not clear,\" said Carrillo, who wondered whether Trump will follow the formal process or seek a quicker deal.\n\nDelays could get worse thanks to a personnel issue: the U.S. trade team is stretched thin. They're juggling talks with dozens of countries \u2014 and Greer has been wearing multiple hats, holding different interim roles in the White House.\n\nWhen negotiations begin, the priorities are no mystery.\n\nEmployees work on an assembly line during the production launch of Chrysler vehicles in Brampton, Ont., in January 2011. (Darren Calabrese/Canadian Press)\n\nCanada's chief goal? Build legal guardrails to stop Trump from firing off tariffs at will \u2014 something a few U.S. lawmakers also favour .\n\nIt's a tall order. Trump won't be keen to surrender his go-to weapon. After all, he just threatened more tariffs against Mexico, in a dispute over water. He's also studying tariffs on semiconductors and pharmaceuticals.\n\nWhat the Americans want most\n\nThe U.S. has several objectives. It's unhappy with Canada's digital services tax. It will either seek adjustments to, or the end of, the supply-management system for dairy, eggs and poultry.\n\nBut its top priority? Scrubbing foreign parts from U.S. manufacturing \u2014 especially Chinese steel and auto components, although it could go farther.\n\nLighthizer was vague on the details in his Ottawa talk, but he called this priority No. 1. Autos are \"the biggest thing,\" he said. \"I hope we tighten it even more.\"\n\nBut he raised another sore spot. Tellingly, he veered off his usual trade lane to take a jab at Canada over defence spending. Canada \"does not pay its share.\u2026 It just doesn't,\" he said. \"And that has to be addressed.\"\n\nThose are likely the broad themes.\n\nThe U.S. will seek changes on autos, dairy, digital taxes, defence spending, and, just maybe, based on recent sniping from Trump, looser banking regulations.\n\nCanada's top priority? Stability. It may chase extra deals \u2014 think softwood lumber \u2014 but the main goal is locking in old ties in a world that's anything but stable.\n\n\"I think we get to the good place eventually,\" Tronnes said. She added a caveat, with a touch of graphic imagery.\n\nCUSMA 'is still alive. It is like, you know, many have said it's under a guillotine right now, just waiting to be sliced apart. But I'm optimistic.\""

                "content": "PARIS - Global wine production and consumption fell in 2024 to their lowest in decades, as extreme weather and high prices weighed on the sector, the International Organisation of Vine and Wine, known as the OIV, said on Tuesday.\n\nAdding to the challenges, wine producers around the world are under threat from tariffs for sales into the United States, the world's largest importer of wine by value.\n\nWine consumption fell 3.3 per cent globally to an estimated 214 million hectolitres, the lowest since 1961, as inflation and reduced consumer spending power eroded demand.\n\nGenerational changes in consumer behaviour and a fall in Chinese consumption, once a major driver, have also played their part in reducing wine drinking since 2018, the OIV said.\n\nGlobal wine production dropped 4.8 per cent to 226 million hectolitres, the lowest level in over 60 years and below the OIV's initial estimate of between 227 mhl and 235 mhl projected in November last year.\n\nA hectolitre is the equivalent of 133 standard wine bottles.\n\nAs in 2023, reduced output, particularly in Europe and parts of the Southern Hemisphere, was caused by adverse weather and disease, OIV Director General John Barker told reporters.\n\nThe surface area of vineyards contracted by 0.6 per cent to 7.1 million hectares in 2024, the fourth consecutive year of decline. The reduction reflects ongoing structural changes, including the removal of vineyards, to grow grapes for wine and other products, in both hemispheres.\n\nAmong the seven countries with the largest areas of vineyards in the world, only Italy, the largest wine exporter by volume, recorded positive growth - at 0.8 per cent.\n\nDespite the reduced volumes, higher average prices supported the market in value terms.\n\nInternational wine trade was at its lowest level in volume since 2010, pressured by high prices and weakened demand, but it grew in value as premium segments proved more resilient.\n\nExports totalled 99.8 million hectolitres, matching 2023 levels but falling 5 per cent below the five-year average. Export value increased to 35.9 billion euros ($38.9 billion), driven by stable record-high prices averaging 3.60 euro per litre.\n\nOf this, wine import value in the United States totalled 6.3 billion euros last year, up 1.6 per cent on 2023, far ahead of the United Kingdom at 4.6 billion euros and Germany at 2.5 billion."

It is a claim that is not supported by facts.\n\nAccording to the latest OECD estimates, energy prices paid by consumers in Australia have fallen by the most of the 38 countries included in the survey.

No new EWS certificates will be issued by the revenue department till further orders,\" he said.\n\nThe former Delhi minister said the decision will immediately impact students applying to institutes such as Delhi University and Indraprastha University, where EWS certificates are required for the 10 per cent quota.\n\nHe also flagged concerns about patients being denied hospital beds and services reserved for the EWS category.\n\nMr Bharadwaj alleged that the move would deprive the poor of access to education, healthcare, and job opportunities under the EWS category and termed it a \"deliberate attempt\" to benefit private institutions.\n\nClaiming that thousands of students and job aspirants could be affected due to the \"halt\" in issuance of EWS certificates, the AAP leader said, \"This government is entirely anti-poor.\" Targeting Chief Minister Gupta, he questioned the rationale behind \"punishing the public\" instead of taking action against officials allegedly responsible for issuing certificates to ineligible persons.\n\n\"How many officials has she suspended? If the certificates were wrongly issued, why hasn't any Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM), Additional District Magistrate (ADM) or District Magistrate (DM) faced action?\" Mr Bharadwaj asked\n\nThe AAP leader also accused the BJP of trying to avoid accountability in what he called an attempt to shield private institutions and benefit them by curbing EWS access.\n\nDelhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva rejected the claims, saying the issuance of EWS certificates has not been stopped.\n\nHe clarified that the chief minister has only called for the formulation of proper guidelines to prevent the misuse of the certificates. The economically weaker sections would continue getting benefits, Mr Sachdeva asserted.\n\nHe accused AAP of spreading misinformation to avoid scrutiny of the alleged irregularities during its rule.\n\nFake EWS and caste certificates were issued between 2015 and 2024 under pressure from AAP leaders, resulting in their misuse in school admissions and availing of hospital facilities and other government benefits, the BJP leader claimed.\n\n\"The people of Delhi understand why Saurabh Bharadwaj is creating a controversy. He fears an investigation will expose a massive scam,\" Mr Sachdeva said.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"

In quarterly terms, inflation was 2.1% in the March quarter 2022 and 1.8% in the June quarter 2022. (Source: Australian Bureau of Statistics)\n\nThis inflation rate was crippling Australian consumers and business and forced the RBA to embark on an aggressive interest rate hiking cycle.\n\nInflation has fallen sharply, from a peak of 7.8% in the year to the December quarter 2022, to 2.4% in the year to the December quarter 2024 (latest ABS quarterly data). In quarterly terms, inflation was 0.2% in each of the September and December quarters of 2024, which are annualised increases under 1 per cent.\n\nIn reaction to this easing in cost of living pressures, the Reserve Bank has started an interest rate cutting cycle, with a rate cut on 18 February 2025 and, at the time of writing, expectations in financial markets were for interest rates to fall a further 110 basis points to 3.0% (the current official interest rate is 4.1%).\n\nDon't be misled.

                "content": "Over the past month, both Four Corners and 60 Minutes have done major investigations into Australia\u2019s $5 billion tobacco black market and the criminal gangs who now dominate the industry.\n\nNick McKenzie\u2019s 60 Minutes report began by squarely laying the blame for the crisis on the Commonwealth Health Department\u2019s tobacco policies.\n\n\u2018Where there\u2019s smoke, there\u2019s firebombing,\u2019 he began, describing the reality for tobacconists in Victoria and increasingly throughout Australia.\n\nMcKenzie continued:\n\nIn the last 18 months, as many as 200 shops have been destroyed as criminals try to wrest control of the lucrative illegal tobacco market. What's concerning, though, is not only the level of violence, but why this thuggery started in the first place by taxing cigarettes so exorbitantly in an attempt to stop people smoking. What the Government has inadvertently created is a thriving black market worth $5 billion a year.\n\nDan Oakes\u2019 Four Corners report, \u2018Tobacco Wars\u2019, began on an equally critical note:\n\n\u201cBringing death and destruction to Australia's streets, it's costing the Federal Government billions in lost taxes, and threatening decades of hard-won progress in the fight against deadly tobacco.\u201d\n\nFormer Australian Federal Police detective superintendent Rohan Pike, who created and led the Australian Border Force\u2019s Tobacco Taskforce in 2015 but now works as a lobbyist for the Australian Association of Convenience Stores (AACS), followed.\n\nPike said:\n\n\u201cPeople here are sick of firebombings every second day. And it just gives the impression that law and order is out of control. This policy is perhaps one of the biggest failures in Australian history.\u201d\n\nAustralia\u2019s tobacco policy also received a dishonourable mention in the 2025 Federal Budget with the revelation that the fall in the sale of legal cigarettes had led to a precipitous decline in the tobacco excise that was projected to blow a $10 billion hole in the Budget\u2019s prediction of revenue collected over the next four years. The tobacco tax peaked at $16.8 billion in 2019, declined to $10 billion in 2023 and was projected to fall to $6.4 billion in 2028.\n\nFor comparison, the money required for supplementary funding to increase our Medicare billing rates over the next four years was estimated at $8.5 billion.\n\nCommenting on the tobacco tax decline in the Australian Financial Review, economist Chris Richardson labelled Australia\u2019s tobacco tax a $10 billion policy mistake that has fuelled organised crime and worsened health outcomes.\n\nRichardson condemned the absurd increase in tobacco tax:\n\nThe politicians got greedy and tobacco taxes are already up by more than a factor of five since 2010. However, Australia has raised tobacco taxes so far and so fast that we\u2019ve spawned a vast black market. The tax take is telling us that Australians jumped into the black market. That\u2019s been a godsend for criminals. This is a market that is just as profitable as heroin, but with a fraction of the legal consequences if you\u2019re caught.\n\nChris Richardson was largely correct, except that putting a heavy tax on smoking was done for two reasons: to raise revenue, as he said, but secondly to discourage people from smoking. When the health authorities saw the excise was down, they misinterpreted the data as proof that their tax policies were working, but wishful thinking is never a good basis for policy. The wastewater testing (below) showed the nicotine was still there, but it was masked by the black market.\n\nThe chief executive of the AACS, Theo Foukkare, called on the Federal Government to freeze the excise on tobacco products for four years, along with legalising and regulating smoking cessation tools such as vapes, and strengthening the crackdown on illegal tobacco:\n\n\u201cThe definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome. The Government, with their policy around tobacco excise and vaping prohibition, is doing exactly that. If it is revenue that the Government is after, it should legalise and tax cannabis.\u201d\n\nThe two sides of the nicotine debate\n\n\u2018...raising tobacco taxes is one of the most effective mechanisms for governments to reduce population consumption of tobacco.\u2019 ~ \u2018Tobacco in Australia\u2019, Australian Department of Health.\n\nAustralia\u2019s road to tobacco policy hell was paved with the very best of intentions, to reduce the consumption of tobacco, so how did it go so wrong?\n\nSince the Health Department regarded price as the best way to reduce tobacco use, it adopted the crazy policy of increasing the tobacco tax by 12.5% every year, starting in 2013 and ending in 2021. In 2023, in his second budget, Treasurer Jim Chalmers announced a further 15% increase in the tobacco tax, estimating it would bring in an extra $3.3 billion over the next three years.\n\nAs the graph indicates, the Treasurer\u2019s prediction was out by about minus ten billion dollars, which shows how woefully ignorant our Treasurer is about how excise tax works.\n\nFor Bay FM, I interviewed Dr Alex Wodak, the tobacco harm reduction adviser to the Harm Reduction Australia Board, who explained excise tax in a way even Jim Chalmers might understand:\n\n\u201cEconomists talk about a Laffer curve. This occurs when trying to estimate what the optimal taxation rate for a commodity is. If the taxation rate is too low, government revenue is not optimised because the rate is too low. If it is too high, government revenue falls away and there is widespread noncompliance, and people go to the black market. That's the situation we are in with cigarette taxation in Australia.\u201d\n\nHarm reduction relies on helping consumers choose safer methods of consumption. Unlike prohibitionists, harm reductionists avoid a judgemental approach to drug taking or drug takers but seek to educate consumers about how to avoid harms.\n\nLung cancer is a major cause of death for tobacco smokers, but this results from inhaling the tars caused by burning tobacco, not from the nicotine. So the harm reduction approach is to encourage other means of consumption like vaping, which is inhaling nicotine aerosols, nicotine patches and so on.\n\nProfessor Simon Chapman is arguably the chief architect of Australia\u2019s disastrous tobacco policies. Interviewed by Four Corners, he argued against reducing the tobacco tax, asserting that big tobacco exaggerates the size of the black market.\n\nChapman said:\n\n\u201cWe have a principle called the scream test. Basically, this means that if you follow the media monitors and follow what the tobacco companies are saying, if they are screaming very loud you know that is a policy that is going to bite hard on their bottom line and the things that they have screamed loudest about throughout my career is probably tax number one.\u201d\n\nDan Oakes then asked Simon Chapman the question many were pleased he did:\n\n\u201cYou have a deep-seated hatred of big tobacco. Do you think this risks blinding you to what people are saying in good faith?\u201d\n\nChapman replied, dismissing sincere experts like Rohan Pike and Dr Alex Wodak with this insult:\n\n\u201cI think they should look in the mirror and see that what they are asking for is exactly the same as what Big Tobacco is asking for. Political useful idiots.\u201d\n\nIn our interview, Dr Wodak replied, not with an ad hominin attack, but with a policy-based disagreement:\n\nAustralia's response to tobacco since 2010, more and more resembles the way Australia and many other countries have responded to the war on drugs with extremism \u2014 with the intentional provision of misinformation and disinformation, refusal to have any discussion or debate in public or even in private with people who disagree with that policy, extreme hubris. Really, the long and the short of it is that Australia's response to tobacco since about 2010 has looked more and more like a war on nicotine.\n\nIn their commentary in the Australian Harm Reduction Journal, James Martin and Edward Jegasothy agreed with Dr Wodak, arguing that Australia\u2019s intensified regulatory approach toward nicotine control revealed a shift that increasingly resembles a de facto war on nicotine.\n\nMartin and Jegasothy wrote:\n\n\u2018...recent policies \u2013 including increased tobacco taxation and a ban on consumer vapes \u2013 have inadvertently fuelled a burgeoning nicotine black market. This has resulted in serious unintended consequences, including increased criminal activity, systemic violence and health risks associated with the proliferation of unregulated nicotine products.\u2019\n\nThe combination of sky-high cigarette prices and the Health Department\u2019s overwhelming obsession with cutting smoking rates had combined in a perfect storm to fuel an explosion in Australia\u2019s tobacco black market. Our tobacco policies were creating more harm than they mitigated, mirroring many of the unintended consequences historically associated with drug prohibition.\n\nDan Oakes also interviewed Health Minister Mark Butler and asked if the Government would consider pausing tobacco tax increases to freeze legal prices and starve the black market of customers.\n\nEchoing Simon Chapman, he replied that this was something the tobacco industry lobbied for, but that would be \u201craising the white flag\u201d and letting criminals and the industry dictate government policy.\n\nHowever, he could not deny that organised crime was already controlling the market:\n\n\u201cWell, that's right, they've been able to get a foothold and I regret that that's the case, but, you know, the best time to deal with this would've been five years ago. The second-best time is to deal with it now.\u201d\n\nRohan Pike disagreed. The best time was a decade ago when he alerted Border Force and the Government to the problem, but denial reigned then as it does now, and his warnings were ignored. Mark Butler\u2019s solution was too little and too late. The black market was so widespread and entrenched that average citizens no longer had any qualms about participating in the black market.\n\nPike said:\n\n\u201cGiven that excise rates are the primary driver of this problem, from the start we should be looking at reducing the excise rates to a level that doesn't encourage people to go to the illicit market.\u201d\n\nHealth's response to the rise of vaping\n\nCould Australia\u2019s disastrous tobacco policy possibly get any worse?\n\nGiven the geniuses we have running the Health Department, this proved no problem.\n\nAllow me to illustrate:\n\nThis is a graphic from the article titled Analysis of wastewater from 2013 to 2021 detected a recent increase in nicotine use in Queensland, Australia. It plots the levels of nicotine measured between 2013 and 2021 in a wastewater treatment plant serving over 100,000 people in southeast Queensland.\n\nTracing different metabolites, one measuring tobacco-based nicotine use from cigarettes, the other measuring non-tobacco nicotine use from vapes, nicotine patches and other nicotine replacement therapies, it shows the transformation in nicotine consumption between 2013 and 2021 as e-cigarettes or vapes replaced cigarette use. Vapes are recommended as safer than cigarettes because they are free from the tars released by burning tobacco, the major cause of lung cancer in tobacco smokers.\n\nThe graph shows how nicotine users\u2019 concerns about lung cancer changed the pattern of nicotine use in Australia. However, the rise of vapes worried the nicotine prohibitionists in the Health Department, and they set about banning vapes and successfully driving vapes, which are comparable in size to the cigarette market, into the black market as well.\n\nNicotine vapes were made harder to obtain with an \u2018enhanced regulatory approach to vaping\u2019, according to the 2023 Budget Papers, which required vape users to obtain a prescription from their doctor to legally obtain vapes. Fruity flavours and colourful packaging were also abolished to make vapes less appealing.\n\nOverwhelmingly, this caused vapers to shift to the black market. The National Drug Strategy Household Survey 2022\u20132023 reported that 1.8 million Australians smoked tobacco, while 1.5 million used vapes, a figure that had tripled from 2019. A vast majority (87%) of people who had used e\u2011cigarettes with nicotine reported that they had obtained them without a prescription (from the black market).\n\nSaid Dr Wodak:\n\nWe have a policy rigidity problem with vaping. The customers, the people who vape, have gone to the black market. The problem with that is they're getting unregulated vapes over which governments have no control, so it it's a failed and futile policy which is unsustainable and sooner or later, I hope, the policy will collapse and the Government will have to introduce a much more realistic policy both for cigarette excise but also for vaping.\n\nOur interview ended with this bizarrely contrarian observation from Dr Wodak who said:\n\nIt is a curious situation that we're in, that we have to be grateful to the black market \u2013 run, of course, by criminals \u2013 but we have to be grateful to the criminals and for the black market that they have helped to accelerate the decline in smoking and switch people who enjoy nicotine to help them switch from high risk deadly cigarettes to low risk, safer vaping. So it's the criminals who have provided the market for people who want to keep on using nicotine.\n\nDr John Jiggens is a writer and journalist currently working in the community newsroom at Bay-FM in Byron Bay."

                "content": "N. Ram, former Editor-in-Chief of The Hindu, on Tuesday said Tamil Nadu Governor R.N. Ravi would be among the top three worst Governors in the history of independent India.\n\nHe was speaking at an event organised by the Tamil Nadu Intellectuals\u2019 Forum at Periyar Thidal on the recent Supreme Court verdict in the case regarding the Governor\u2019s inaction on/withholding of assent to 10 Bills passed by the Tamil Nadu Assembly. \u201cToday, there is a total attack on the concept of federalism. A Governor is the instrument. If we take a list of the worst Governors in the history of independent India, R.N. Ravi would be in the top three. Not just the BJP, but the Congress has also behaved badly in the Governor issue (in the past). The situation changed after the judgment in the S.R. Bommai case.\u201d\n\nMr. Ram said the Supreme Court had previously been criticised by constitutional lawyers for becoming an \u2018executive court\u2019.\n\n\u201cI have also participated in making that criticism...in the Kashmir issue, Citizenship Amendment Act...there has been no justice....these are fair questions. However, that the Supreme Court is not an executive court has been made clear (by the recent verdict on the Governor\u2019s inaction),\u201d he said, adding that even the BJP-ruled States should welcome the verdict.\n\nDMK Rajya Sabha member P. Wilson said the verdict had put a full-stop to the Governor\u2019s tactics of delaying assent to Bills passed by elected State governments across India.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in India, a law has come into force without the assent of the Governor or the President. Ten Bills have become law, and we have won the case. The Supreme Court states that no constitutional authority is above the law. I hope that if the time limit for the Governor is reviewed, the Supreme Court will not reject it. The Constitution is a living document, and it cannot be misused,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Wilson said the verdict had fixed a time limit of 30 days for the Governor of a State to take action on a Bill, and had said the courts could be approached if no action is taken within 30 days.\n\n\u201cIf the Bill is sent to the President and withheld, a case can be filed in the court. If a Bill is re-enacted, a Governor should take a decision within 30 days. According to the verdict, Governors cannot delay. They don\u2019t have any other work than signing Bills. The Governor\u2019s office is operated with taxpayers\u2019 money,\u201d he said.\n\nDMK Rajya Sabha member N.R. Elango said Chief Minister M.K. Stalin had kept himself abreast of all the developments in the case. \u201cAs far as I know, Chief Minister Stalin didn\u2019t file the case against the Union government or Governor R.N. Ravi. He filed the case because he wanted to protect State rights and Tamil Nadu\u2019s interests,\u201d he said.\n\nDravidar Kazhagam president K. Veeramani said the Supreme Court had not criticised any other Governor the way it had criticised Mr. Ravi."
