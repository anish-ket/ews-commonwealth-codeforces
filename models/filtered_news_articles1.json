In an interview with Bloomberg Technology, the CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, said that Musk \u201cdoesn\u2019t care\u201d about the electric car manufacturer. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that he just doesn\u2019t care. His next move is X AI\u2026 So if you have any confusion that he\u2019s coming back to Tesla, he\u2019s not,\u201d he said during the interview.In March, Gerber said that Musk has lost focus given his widening interests and has become too \u2018divisive\u2019. Blaming social media posts and involvement with the president Donald Trump for bringing negative publicity to the company, he then said that \u201cthe company's reputation has just been destroyed by Elon Musk\u201d.In the Bloomberg interview, Gerber also defended his criticism after a backlash from retail investors. He said \u201cI understand why retail investors at Tesla are frustrated with me for voicing my views\u201d adding that he\u2019s \u201cgetting attacked because of Elon\u2019s behavior.\u201dHowever, Gerber said that his firm will continue to manage Tesla shares. He said \u201cWe still own Tesla because I do think something fixes itself at some point, and they have the best products\u201d.While Tesla continues to lead the US EV market, the company\u2019s stocks have declined 33% year-to-date. According to Cox Automotive data, Tesla sales fell 8.6% year over year in the first quarter of 2025, while the market expanded 11.4% as a whole.",

        "content": "Iran is dangerously close to developing an atomic weapon, warned the International Atomic Energy Agency, hours before the UN watchdog's chief is expected to leave for Tehran. During his visit, the top nuclear body chief will hold talks with Iranian government officials over recent developments in its top secret nuclear programme.\n\nRafael Grossi, who heads the IAEA, likened the development of a nuclear weapon to that of solving a jigsaw puzzle. \"Iran has all the pieces now, and could well put them together eventually,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking about Tehran's nuclear weapons ambition, Mr Grossi told French newspaper Le Monde that \"Iran is not too far from having an atomic bomb\".\n\nIAEA, which is an autonomous UN body, is currently tasked with overseeing Iran's compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal that fell apart after Donald Trump withdrew from it during his first term as US President. At the time President Trump had called it a \"bad deal\".\n\n'RADICALS CANNOT HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS'\n\nHe now wants to completely rid Iran of its military nuclear programme. Just this week, President Trump had asserted that \"Iran has to get rid of the concept of a nuclear weapon. These are radicalised people, and they cannot have a nuclear weapon.\"\n\nHis remark came shortly after the first round of talks between Washington and Tehran which were held in Oman last weekend.\n\nAfter the first round of negotiations, US's Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff, who represented America, said that the talks were \"positive, constructive, and compelling\". Surprisingly, even Iran's Supreme Leader said the talks are \"going well\" so far. Iran however, swiftly sent a top delegation headed by the foreign minister to Moscow to consult the Kremlin.\n\nThe second round of talks are expected in Rome, though Tehran is pushing for talks to continue in Oman.\n\nExplaining Washington's outlook and objectives from these talks, Mr Witkoff told Fox News that \"This is going to be much about verification on the enrichment program, and then ultimately verification on weaponization. That includes missiles, the type of missiles that they have stockpiled there. And it includes the trigger for a bomb.\"\n\nTECHNICAL DETAILS\n\nFurther explaining his point, Mr Witkoff said that for the first time Iran had been offered a specific level of enrichment by the United States. Today, Tehran enriches uranium to up to 60 per cent - a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90 per cent.\n\nFor their limited, peaceful and civilian purpose, \"They (Iran) do not need to enrich past 3.67 per cent,\" Mr Witkoff told Fox News, adding that \"In some circumstances, they're at 60 per cent, in other circumstances, 20 per cent. That cannot be.\"\n\n\"You do not need to run, as they claim, a civil nuclear program where you're enriching past 3.67 per cent. So this is going to be much about verification on the enrichment program, and then ultimately verification on weaponisation.\"\n\nOBAMA DEAL vs TRUMP DEAL\n\nUnder then US President Barack Obama, for the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, Tehran had agreed to drastically reduce its stockpile of uranium and only enrich up to 3.67 per cent - enough for its nuclear power plant at Bushehr. In exchange, Iran received access to frozen funds around the world, and sanctions were lifted on its crucial oil industry and other sectors.\n\nIn 2018, when Donald Trump withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, he had highlighted that Iran's ballistic missile stockpile was one of the main reasons to exit the deal. Adding to that, Mr Witkoff said that \"Any deal with Iran would have to include missiles - the type of missiles that they have stockpiled there and it also includes the trigger for a bomb.\"\n\nIn a post on social media platform X after the first round of US-Iran talks, Mr Witkoff wrote, \"A deal with Iran will only be completed if it is a Trump deal.\"\n\n",

He urged both the State and Central governments to resolve the issue through a one-time settlement, stating that the Supreme Court had already ruled in favour of equal pay for equal work, rendering the continuation of this disparity indefensible.\n\nBC Association national president and Rajya Sabha MP R. Krishnaiah pledged to raise the issue both at the State and national levels, declaring he would speak in Parliament if necessary.\n\nOpposition leaders from across party lines echoed similar sentiments.\n\nCPI Telangana secretary and MLA Kunanneni Sambasiva Rao criticised successive governments for failing to address the legitimate demands of contract educators and urged the current administration to act swiftly.\n\nLeader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council Dr. Madhusudhana Chari assured continued support until the demands are met, while BJP MLC Anji Reddy and party general secretary Kasam Venkateswarlu also backed the protest, with Venkateswarlu offering to liaise with the Centre to clear UGC-related obstacles.\n\nCongress spokesperson Harshavardhan Reddy stated that he would immediately take up the issue with the Chief Minister and press for a solution.\n\nBC Welfare Association president Jajula Srinivas Goud highlighted the financial strain faced by contract professors. \u201cIf the State government pays less salaries to contract teachers working in universities, how will they do their jobs? They also have wives, children, household expenses, monthly expenses, and health expenses. In such a situation, they should worry about whether they should work for poor salaries or face daily hardships,\u201d he said, and called for the urgent organisation of an all-party delegation to meet with the government.",

He has represented the Civil Lines (Jaipur) seat in the Rajasthan assembly.\n\nSingh, 63, is the promoter of a real estate firm named Janta Land Promoters Limited (JLPL).

Before these searches, it arrested Hayer.\n\nBhangoo died in August last year.\n\nThe agency has attached assets worth \u20b9706 crore, including two immovable properties worth \u20b9462 crore in Australia, and filed two charge sheets against PACL, Bhangoo and others.\n\nKhachariyawas claimed that the ED had come to search his house to scare him.\n\n\"The BJP is arrogant. It has been in power at the Centre for 11 years and it is also in power in Rajasthan.

        "content": "Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah has fiercely rejected claims by ex-R&AW chief Amarjit Singh Dulat that he had \u201cprivately backed\u201d the abrogation of Article 370, describing them as a \u201ccheap stunt\u201d designed to boost sales of Dulat\u2019s forthcoming memoir, The Chief Minister and the Spy, due for release on 18 April.\n\nIn response, the ex R&AW chief has claimed that he has been \u2018misquoted\u2019. \u201cMy book is full of praise for Farooq Abdullah, there is nothing against him,\u201d, Dulat said.\n\nDulat\u2019s Allegations and Abdullah\u2019s Response Dulat\u2019s book alleges that Abdullah and his National Conference (NC) might have supported the removal of Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s special status had they been consulted, and that the party would have helped pass a resolution in the assembly if taken into confidence.\n\nAbdullah, now 87, dismissed these assertions as \u201cfiction\u201d and \u201ca figment of the author\u2019s imagination,\u201d insisting that both he and his son Omar Abdullah were detained for months at the time of the abrogation in August 2019 precisely because their opposition to the move was well known.\n\nNo Assembly, No Resolution Farooq Abdullah was scathing about the suggestion that the NC could have facilitated the passage of a resolution to revoke Article 370. He pointed out that there was no legislative assembly in 2018, as it had already been dissolved. \u201cA benchmark of common sense should have been adopted by the author while penning the so-called memoirs\", the ex J&K CM said.\n\n\"He should have remembered that there was no assembly in 2018, which could have been dissolved,\u201d Abdullah remarked.\n\nChampioning Special Status for Kashmir Farooq Abdullah reiterated his consistent stance in defence of Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s special status. He highlighted his role in bringing together major political forces in the region to form the People\u2019s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), a coalition committed to restoring the state\u2019s autonomy.\n\nAbdullah emphasised that his record, including passing a resolution for greater autonomy when he held a two-thirds majority in 1996, contradicts Dulat\u2019s claims.\n\nOn Relationship with Dulat and the BJP Abdullah also refuted Dulat\u2019s portrayal of their relationship, rejecting the notion that he was easily influenced by the former spy chief. \u201cThe author claims that Abdullah would always listen to his advice, which is yet another example of underestimating me. I am a man of my own mind, and I only decide. I am not anyone\u2019s puppet,\u201d he asserted.\n\nHe further dismissed suggestions that the NC sought closer ties with the BJP, calling it \u201can absolute lie\u201d and reaffirming his unwillingness to associate with a party he accuses of seeking to \u201cdestroy\u201d his own.\n\nDisputing the Memoir\u2019s Accuracy Farooq Abdullah described Dulat\u2019s memoir as riddled with inaccuracies, likening it to \u201cfiction\u201d and stating he abandoned reading it partway through. He also challenged specific claims, such as Dulat\u2019s alleged advice on cabinet size in 1996, pointing out factual errors in the account.\n\n\u201cWound That Lasts a Lifetime\u201d Expressing disappointment, Abdullah said Dulat\u2019s actions had left a lasting wound: \u201cThe worst is that he claims to be my friend, and as has been said, \u2018Stab the body and it heals, but injure the heart, and the wound lasts a lifetime.\u2019 I guess his inaccuracies just for cheap publicity would last a lifetime now\u201d.\n\n\u2018My Book is Full of Praise\u2019 Amid a political storm in Jammu and Kashmir over some mentions concerning Farooq Abdullah in his new book 'The Chief Minister and the Spy', former RAW Chief Amarjit Singh Dulat has said that the \"book is full of praise\" for the former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and has \"nothing against him\".",

The judge posted the next hearing for the matter on April 25.The ED chargesheet also named Congress members Sam Pitroda and Suman Dubey as accused.The Congress, on April 15, called for nationwide protests against the BJP government and the ED action.The protests have sparked debate over the agency's position as being a puppet of the Union government, and a spar between the BJP and Congress workers along with their supporters online.With Congress leaders accusing the BJP of misusing the agency for its political gains, BJP members stated that Congress was afraid of the action due to its role in the case.Congress national spokesperson Jairam Ramesh called the action \"political vendetta\" and a \"state-sponsored crime\".\"Seizing the assets of the National Herald is a state-sponsored crime masquerading as the rule of law. Filing chargesheets against Smt. Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and some others is nothing but the politics of vendetta and intimidation by the PM and the HM gone completely berserk.

Satyameva Jayate,\" Ramesh wrote on X (formerly Twitter).BJP spokesperson CR Kesavan said the protests against the agency's action only raised more suspicion on the role of Congress leaders.\"Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi, who are out on bail in the National Herald case, may be above the rules and constitution of the dynastic Congress party but they are not above Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar's Constitution where everybody is equal before the law of the land,\" Kesavan told PTI.\"Protest against the chargesheet by the Congress party today in an effort to intimidate the agencies only raises more serious suspicions about the integrity of the Congress leadership in the National Herald case,\" he added.Congress MP KC Venugopal slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah for the ED action by calling it a witch-hunt against the Congress leaders to silence the opposition.\"The Modi-Shah regime\u2019s vendetta against the Opposition knows no bounds.

The state government has reduced the number of active beneficiaries by 17 lakh, and cut monthly financial benefits for another 7.7 lakh women.According to the government data, these 7.7 lakh women were earlier receiving1,500 per month under the scheme, but are now receiving only500. The state clarified that this adjustment is because these beneficiaries are receiving1,000 per month under the Namo Shetkari Mahasamman Nidhi, and the Ladki Bahin scheme allows for a maximum combined monthly benefit of1,500.Maharashtra Women and Child Development Minister Aditi Tatkare said in line with the policy, the difference of500 is being paid to 7,74,148 women who are receiving1,000 per month under the Namo Shetkari Samman Yojana.\"No eligible woman has been excluded from the Ladki Bahin scheme, and no change has been made in the said process after July 3, 2024,\" said the Nationalist Congress Party leader, adding that she has clarified about the same during the budget session of the state legislature.The process of scrutinising the list of beneficiaries began soon after the formation of the new government. In December 2024, the government had announced that all beneficiaries would be re-evaluated and anyone found ineligible would be removed from the scheme. Disqualification criteria include owning a four-wheeler or having a family income exceeding2.5 lakh per annum.Before this re-evaluation, the scheme had 2.63 crore beneficiaries. However, for the months of February and March 2025, benefits were transferred to only 2.46 crore women, a drop of 17 lakh recipients.The move has sparked criticism from the Opposition, which alleges that the BJP-led Mahayuti government used the scheme to secure votes before the elections and is now withdrawing benefits. The Opposition claimed the move is a betrayal of women voters, accusing the government of vote-buying tactics followed by post-election rollbacks.\"On the eve of the elections, the Mahayuti coalition promised a farm loan waiver, and after forming a government, it asked farmers to repay their loans. Women are being removed from the list of beneficiaries of the Ladki Bahin scheme citing various reasons. The corrupt Mahayuti government is betraying the trust of the people,\" said State Congress president Harshwardhan Sapkal.",

        "content": "Who would have thought that an opioid drug could trigger a global trade disruption\u2014one that now threatens to push the world\u2019s largest economy into a recession?It may be recalled that President Trump, in his executive order dated February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties to Address the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC)), determined that the People's Republic of China (PRC) had failed to stem the sustained influx of synthetic opioids, including fentanyl. The order stated that these drugs posed an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.The executive order concluded that the PRC had not taken adequate steps to alleviate the drug crisis; fentanyl continued to be illegally imported under false invoices, fraudulent postage, and deceptive packaging. This had resulted in the seizure of over 500,000 pounds of drugs and the deaths of thousands of Americans. The order declared a national emergency under the National Emergencies Act and invoked powers under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This Act authorises the President to regulate international commerce in response to such threats. An additional 10% ad valorem duty was imposed on all products from the PRC entering the USA.Subsequent executive orders\u2014culminating in the latest on 9 April\u2014shifted focus towards addressing the large and persistent annual US goods trade deficits. Tariffs were imposed on imports from all countries. With regard to the PRC, the dual conclusion\u2014that the PRC had not done enough to curb the production and smuggling of fentanyl, and that the trade deficit with the PRC remained vast\u2014resulted in an unprecedented 145% (now 245%) levy on all goods imported from China. Further, the de minimis exemption (normally applicable to imports valued under $800) was withdrawn for PRC-origin goods. All e-commerce shipments from China are now subject to elevated tariffs.What then is fentanyl, and why is it of such concern to the United States?Fentanyl is a potent synthetic opioid, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an analgesic and anaesthetic. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has stated that it is 100 times more potent than morphine and 50 times more potent than heroin\u2014and extremely addictive. Just 2 milligrams\u2014the size of a few grains of sand\u2014can lead to overdose. It can be injected, snorted, smoked, taken as a pill, spiked onto blotter paper, and is often sold alone or in even more lethal combinations. Its effects include rapid relaxation, euphoria, dizziness, nausea, respiratory depression\u2014and frequently, death.First developed in 1959, fentanyl was used widely for medical purposes before its potency and addictive potential were discovered by drug traffickers. It is often called the trafficker\u2019s perfect drug\u2014unlike cocaine or opium, it does not require land for cultivation. A small clandestine lab can produce massive quantities undetected. As profits soared, illicit manufacturing units flourished. Addicts became akin to zombies; the collateral social cost included crime committed to fund addiction, and rising drug overdose deaths.According to the DEA, over 75,000 deaths occur annually in the US from fentanyl overdoses\u2014a figure which rose to 90,000 by August 2024. A vast majority are linked directly to fentanyl. In this light, President Trump\u2019s claim that \"these drugs are threatening the fabric of our society\" may not be entirely exaggerated.The US has long believed that illegal fentanyl supplies originate primarily from China and Mexico. While China claims to have placed all fentanyl-type substances under regulatory control, the US contends enforcement has been lax. There is little visibility of China's effort to curb illicit production. Chinese criminal groups have entered the trade, lured by enormous profits and a vast US market.The Biden administration initiated measures placing China on the US list of major drug-producing and transit countries. Enforcement actions and sanctions were taken against designated individuals and entities. However, Trump has now weaponised the fentanyl issue, imposing a 145% tariff to counter the crisis. Whether this approach addresses the problem is debatable. After all, where there is demand, there will be supply\u2014licit or otherwise. Drug abuse stems from deep social and psychological pressures that must also be addressed.The DEA has also stated that India is a source of finished fentanyl powder and precursor chemicals. However, the website of India\u2019s Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB)\u2014the nodal anti-drug agency\u2014does not list fentanyl among its drugs of concern. The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), which has made significant seizures of methamphetamine, mephedrone, and pseudoephedrine in recent years, has not reported any fentanyl seizures.Yet, earlier this year, the US Attorney\u2019s Office released a statement regarding legal action taken against two Surat-based companies, including their founder and a senior executive, for criminal conspiracy to distribute and import fentanyl precursor chemicals. The charge sheet alleged a false declaration in the manifest\u2014describing the contents as vitamin C, which were actually found to be piperidone, a fentanyl precursor.Indian enforcement agencies must take note of these developments and crack down strongly on the manufacture and export of fentanyl or its precursors. As India already grapples with the impact of 10% tariffs, the last thing it needs is further tariffs imposed for perceived laxity in drug enforcement.\u2014 The author, Najib Shah, is former Chairman, Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs.

Some of the US president's latest tariffs on his favourite bugbear touch 245%. This move is part of Trump's 'America First' trade policy and is the latest in a series of tit-for-tat tariffs imposed by each nation on the other.A White House factsheet, released on Tuesday (April 15) night, described these tariffs as a direct response to China\u2019s recent export controls on critical raw materials and its retaliatory tariffs targeting American exports.The Trump administration accused Beijing of weaponising its control over supply chains by restricting the export of key minerals such as gallium, germanium, and antimony, as well as, more recently, rare earth magnets and six heavy rare earth elements vital to aerospace, defence, and semiconductor manufacturing.\u201cChina now faces up to a 245% tariff on imports to the United States as a result of its retaliatory actions,\u201d the White House stated.In response to the intensifying tariff war, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said President Trump remains open to a trade deal with China, but Beijing must take the first step. Meanwhile, China said it is open to a trade deal only if the US treats it with respect, and appointed a new point-person for whenever these negotiations take place.The impact is extensive, affecting a wide range of products from medical devices to electronics and clothing. Here is a table summarising the new tariff structure, as reported by the New York Times:According to the US Department of Commerce, a significant proportion of China\u2019s exports to the United States are electronics, including smartphones and accessories. In 2022, mechanical appliances, recorders, and televisions accounted for 46.4% of all imports from China.As per the New York Times, in 2024, the United States imported approximately $52 billion worth of smartphones, with over 80% sourced from China. While smartphones from China were initially subject to tariffs of up to 145%, recent customs guidance has exempted laptops and smartphones from the 125% reciprocal tariff on most Chinese goods. However, these devices remain subject to new import taxes introduced earlier in the year.0% base tariff + 20% fentanyl tariff = 20% total tariff rateSyringes and needles now face some of the highest tariff rates, having been targeted by both the previous Trump administration and the Biden administration. In September 2024, the Biden administration imposed a 100% tariff on these items to protect American manufacturing and adopt a firm stance against China.Tariffs on Chinese goods can range from 7.5% to 100%, affecting a variety of products such as clothing, solar panels, and electric vehicles. The latest round of tariffs means American importers will now contend with a 245% tariff on syringes and needles, more than doubling the cost of these products.China remains a leading supplier of textiles, furniture, and various consumer goods. According to the Commerce Department, nearly 30% of textile imports into the United States originate from China. Additionally, over 50% of imports in categories such as furniture and bedding, lamps, toys and games, sports equipment, and miscellaneous manufactured goods are sourced from Chinese producers.Until recently, items such as tricycles, stuffed animals, dolls, and puzzles entered the United States duty-free, keeping prices affordable for American consumers. That is no longer the case.The new tariff rate on toy imports from China is 145%, comprising:Clothing imports have also been affected. Sweaters now face a total tariff of 168.5%, composed of:The tariff structure is not uniform \u2014 it varies according to material origin, product category, and any specific exemptions. Businesses will need to undertake detailed supply chain analyses to determine whether their products are affected, and how much of the increased cost can be absorbed or passed on to consumers.The high tariff on lithium-ion batteries (173%), for example, will directly affect electric vehicle manufacturers, electronics brands, and battery storage companies, especially those sourcing from Chinese factories. Meanwhile, the 70% duty on semiconductors could increase cost pressures on US technology firms already struggling with chip shortages.",

        "content": "Who would have thought that an opioid drug could trigger a global trade disruption\u2014one that now threatens to push the world\u2019s largest economy into a recession?It may be recalled that President Trump, in his executive order dated February 1, 2025 (Imposing Duties to Address the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC)), determined that the People's Republic of China (PRC) had failed to stem the sustained influx of synthetic opioids, including fentanyl. The order stated that these drugs posed an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.The executive order concluded that the PRC had not taken adequate steps to alleviate the drug crisis; fentanyl continued to be illegally imported under false invoices, fraudulent postage, and deceptive packaging. This had resulted in the seizure of over 500,000 pounds of drugs and the deaths of thousands of Americans. The order declared a national emergency under the National Emergencies Act and invoked powers under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This Act authorises the President to regulate international commerce in response to such threats. An additional 10% ad valorem duty was imposed on all products from the PRC entering the USA.Subsequent executive orders\u2014culminating in the latest on 9 April\u2014shifted focus towards addressing the large and persistent annual US goods trade deficits. Tariffs were imposed on imports from all countries. With regard to the PRC, the dual conclusion\u2014that the PRC had not done enough to curb the production and smuggling of fentanyl, and that the trade deficit with the PRC remained vast\u2014resulted in an unprecedented 145% (now 245%) levy on all goods imported from China. Further, the de minimis exemption (normally applicable to imports valued under $800) was withdrawn for PRC-origin goods. All e-commerce shipments from China are now subject to elevated tariffs.What then is fentanyl, and why is it of such concern to the United States?Fentanyl is a potent synthetic opioid, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an analgesic and anaesthetic. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has stated that it is 100 times more potent than morphine and 50 times more potent than heroin\u2014and extremely addictive. Just 2 milligrams\u2014the size of a few grains of sand\u2014can lead to overdose. It can be injected, snorted, smoked, taken as a pill, spiked onto blotter paper, and is often sold alone or in even more lethal combinations. Its effects include rapid relaxation, euphoria, dizziness, nausea, respiratory depression\u2014and frequently, death.First developed in 1959, fentanyl was used widely for medical purposes before its potency and addictive potential were discovered by drug traffickers. It is often called the trafficker\u2019s perfect drug\u2014unlike cocaine or opium, it does not require land for cultivation. A small clandestine lab can produce massive quantities undetected. As profits soared, illicit manufacturing units flourished. Addicts became akin to zombies; the collateral social cost included crime committed to fund addiction, and rising drug overdose deaths.According to the DEA, over 75,000 deaths occur annually in the US from fentanyl overdoses\u2014a figure which rose to 90,000 by August 2024. A vast majority are linked directly to fentanyl. In this light, President Trump\u2019s claim that \"these drugs are threatening the fabric of our society\" may not be entirely exaggerated.The US has long believed that illegal fentanyl supplies originate primarily from China and Mexico. While China claims to have placed all fentanyl-type substances under regulatory control, the US contends enforcement has been lax. There is little visibility of China's effort to curb illicit production. Chinese criminal groups have entered the trade, lured by enormous profits and a vast US market.The Biden administration initiated measures placing China on the US list of major drug-producing and transit countries. Enforcement actions and sanctions were taken against designated individuals and entities. However, Trump has now weaponised the fentanyl issue, imposing a 145% tariff to counter the crisis. Whether this approach addresses the problem is debatable. After all, where there is demand, there will be supply\u2014licit or otherwise. Drug abuse stems from deep social and psychological pressures that must also be addressed.The DEA has also stated that India is a source of finished fentanyl powder and precursor chemicals. However, the website of India\u2019s Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB)\u2014the nodal anti-drug agency\u2014does not list fentanyl among its drugs of concern. The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), which has made significant seizures of methamphetamine, mephedrone, and pseudoephedrine in recent years, has not reported any fentanyl seizures.Yet, earlier this year, the US Attorney\u2019s Office released a statement regarding legal action taken against two Surat-based companies, including their founder and a senior executive, for criminal conspiracy to distribute and import fentanyl precursor chemicals. The charge sheet alleged a false declaration in the manifest\u2014describing the contents as vitamin C, which were actually found to be piperidone, a fentanyl precursor.Indian enforcement agencies must take note of these developments and crack down strongly on the manufacture and export of fentanyl or its precursors. As India already grapples with the impact of 10% tariffs, the last thing it needs is further tariffs imposed for perceived laxity in drug enforcement.\u2014 The author, Najib Shah, is former Chairman, Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs.

        "content": "While the world is still reeling from the high reciprocal tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump, he is not the first president to try solving America\u2019s widening trade deficit by disturbing the global order. He is the third president to do so. But first, let us see why the US repeatedly runs into large trade deficits. The reason lies partly in the US dollar being the world\u2019s reserve currency.India needs dollars to pay for imports from the US. But we also need dollars to pay for imports from Europe, China, the Middle East\u2014indeed, from almost everywhere. So does nearly every country. As a result, we try to run a trade surplus with the US, or we attempt to attract dollars through capital investments from foreign funds. And so do other countries.The net result is that the US is forced into a deficit with most countries. This doesn\u2019t mean the US is an injured party suffering to promote world trade. Quite the opposite\u2014the US enjoys a unique privilege. When it runs a deficit, it merely prints dollars. After all, countries don\u2019t hold their dollars as cash. They invest them in US government bonds.Thus, the US government runs up a fiscal deficit, issues bonds, and other countries buy them, enabling the US to finance both its fiscal and trade deficits at virtually no cost. It only pays the interest. Most countries envy this enormous advantage of the US.French Finance Minister Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing famously called it \u201cthe exorbitant privilege.\u201d Economist Barry Eichengreen put it more starkly:\u201cIt costs only a few cents for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to produce a $100 bill, but other countries have to pony up $100 of actual goods and services in order to obtain one.\u201d \u2013 Prof Barry EichengreenThe disadvantage for the US is that every country wants to devalue its currency against the dollar. This becomes especially painful during economic downturns, such as wars or global financial crises. Typically, global investors flee to the safest asset\u2014the US dollar. So, the dollar strengthens during crises, making recovery harder for the US.Another major drawback is that US manufacturers lose competitiveness as rival countries keep their currencies artificially low. Germany and Japan outclassed US manufacturers from the 1960s to the 1980s. Since the 1990s, China has significantly eroded US manufacturing, in part by keeping the yuan undervalued.But let\u2019s go back to how the US dollar became the world\u2019s exchange currency. A globally accepted currency became increasingly necessary after the First World War, as industrialisation and improved transport systems boosted global trade.Until the Second World War, countries settled trade through the British pound, gold, or\u2014in the case of French colonies\u2014the French franc. But post-WWII, Europe was so devastated that the US dollar became the de facto medium of exchange.Under the Bretton Woods system, the US promised to back every dollar with an equivalent amount of gold, at a fixed rate of $35 per troy ounce. However, by the 1960s, the US had begun printing dollars recklessly\u2014partly to fund the Vietnam War and other anti-communist campaigns and partly to support rising global trade. Eventually, it ran short of gold to back every dollar. In 1971, President Richard Nixon ended the gold standard and dismantled the Bretton Woods system.A floating exchange rate system replaced Bretton Woods. But the dollar remained the global reserve currency, and the need to run deficits continued. Through the 1970s and 1980s, Japanese\u2014and, to some extent, German\u2014goods began outcompeting US products, even within the American market. Mounting deficits once again became a burden for the US.In 1985, the US strong-armed Japan and Europe, particularly Germany\u2014into signing the Plaza Accord, which forced them to appreciate their currencies against the dollar. As a result, the dollar depreciated by over 25% within a year against these currencies.Now, in 2025, we are witnessing a similar situation: US deficits are sky-high, and US manufacturing continues to be outclassed by Chinese goods. But this time, Trump doesn\u2019t command the same clout the US held in 1985\u2014especially over Japan and Germany, nations the US had once helped rebuild and protect post-WWII.Also, central banks\u2019 dollar reserves are no longer large enough to meaningfully distort markets through dollar selling. Global trade and financial markets have grown too vast for any central bank to significantly influence currency values. The US, therefore, resorts to bullying tactics \u2014through threats of high tariffs\u2014to reduce its deficit and attempt to bring back manufacturing to the US.In its favour, it must be said that no viable alternative to the dollar as the global reserve currency has yet emerged. And here\u2019s one more thought: if we are shocked by Trump\u2019s sky-high tariffs and his erratic imposition and withdrawal of them, rest assured\u2014this chaos is minor compared to the shock when the US ended the gold standard! That was monumental. We just don\u2019t remember it because most of us weren\u2019t around back then.As for how high reciprocal tariffs will work to end US deficits while keeping the dollar as the reserve currency\u2014well, that\u2019s a discussion for another day.",

These trains are widely recognised for their speed, comfort, and modern amenities. But have you ever wondered who actually owns these trains? While they run under the banner of Indian Railways, the real ownership lies elsewhere.\n\nSurprisingly, it\u2019s not Indian Railways but the Indian Railway Finance Corporation (IRFC) that owns these premium trains. IRFC, a government-owned public sector enterprise under the Ministry of Railways, is responsible for financing the majority of assets used by Indian Railways. This includes engines, coaches, wagons, and even many of the trains themselves.\n\nRecently, IRFC was granted Navratna status, elevating its financial and operational autonomy. In an exclusive interview with ABP News, IRFC CMD Manoj Kumar Dubey explained how the new status has empowered the company to make faster decisions and boost lending in the railway sector.\n\nDubey also revealed that almost 80 percent of passenger and freight trains used by Indian Railways are technically the property of IRFC. These assets are leased to Indian Railways for a period of 30 years, during which the ownership remains with IRFC. The company uses its own funds raised from markets at competitive rates to finance the production and acquisition of coaches and locomotives.\n\nThis leasing model allows Indian Railways to run trains without bearing the full financial burden of ownership. From the sleek Vande Bharat to the long-trusted Shatabdi and Rajdhani, these trains remain IRFC\u2019s assets on paper while Indian Railways operates them across the country.\n\nApart from funding rolling stock, IRFC also plays a key role in financing projects linked to railway infrastructure and logistics. With the new Navratna status, IRFC plans to expand its portfolio beyond traditional lending, strengthening the overall railway ecosystem.\n\nIn FY25, Indian Railways achieved a 9 percent growth in coach manufacturing, producing over 7,000 coaches, a reflection of its expanding capacity. But behind this growth is IRFC, silently powering India\u2019s rail revolution.\n\nAlso read: Meet the richest DM of UP, 2011 batch IAS officer, whose total assests are worth Rs...",

These are not mining leases,\u201d he said.\n\nThe state government, he explained, has not reached the stage of deciding on any mining concessions, adding that all matters involving royalties, equity and licence terms would be determined by the Cabinet if and when it comes to that.\n\nDatuk Seri Mohd Shafie Apdal (Warisan-Senallang) had earlier expressed concern that granting prospecting licences to private firms might lead to an automatic expectation for mining rights, potentially depriving the state of direct control over its natural resources.\n\nIn reply, Hajiji acknowledged the concern but said the current approach allows the state to avoid incurring financial liabilities associated with high-risk exploration.\n\n\u201cThe exploration of minerals involves high capital and risk. By letting private entities bear that cost, the government can focus on monitoring, environmental protection and policy oversight,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the government remains committed to protecting the state\u2019s interests, and that any eventual decision on mining would include a discussion on the level of state ownership or equity, including the option to channel such projects through state-linked companies.\n\n\u201cIf we give prospecting rights, there must be some potential for them to be considered later. Otherwise, no company would want to invest millions to explore with zero opportunity,\u201d Hajiji added.\n\nHe assured the assembly that transparency remains a priority and said the list of companies given prospecting licences could be obtained from Sabah Mineral Management Sdn Bhd (SMM) and the Companies Commission of Malaysia.\n\n\u201cWe are not hiding anything,\u201d he said.\n\nShafie, however, insisted that state agencies such as Yayasan Sabah or other government-linked entities should lead mineral exploration, to ensure that any profits go back to the people.\n\n\u201cI strongly oppose giving this to private individuals. If there is gold, it should belong to the state,\u201d he said.\n\nHe cited past controversies such as the alleged illegal mining activities in Tawau, where tonnes of gold were believed to have been extracted without clear benefit to Sabah.\n\nThe issue of gold exploration was raised during the winding-up debate at the Sabah state assembly, following allegations that some 1,000ha in Nagos, Semporna had been quietly allocated to private interests.\n\nHajiji reiterated that no mining lease had been approved for that area or any other, and pledged to keep the assembly informed of further developments.",

        "content": "By the end of the hour, Albanese seemed more assured. Dutton did not get the victory he wanted, at the very point he needed to lift his campaign. Verdict: Albanese In the first 2025 election debate, Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton fought each other to a nil-all draw, and viewers were the losers. What a difference a week can make. This was a serious debate and one in which both leaders gave unconvincing answers to detailed questions.\n\nHousing opened the debate. Albanese focused on his government\u2019s own policy proposals whereas Dutton started by criticising Labor before Speers asked about the regressive nature of his signature housing policy. Dutton did not give a convincing answer when asked about the policy\u2019s lack of fairness, while neither man gave an answer that will satisfy anyone who wants negative gearing and capital gains tax breaks scaled back. Key moments in the second debate Credit: ABC Pool Both said no changes are planned, but Albanese didn\u2019t sound believable when asked whether negative gearing changes had been modelled by Treasury. \u201cIt certainly wasn\u2019t commissioned by us\u201d is not a convincing answer. There were questions on the economy, Indigenous disadvantage, Donald Trump and foreign policy. But it was when the two men were asked what big political reform they would like to be remembered for that the debate was most revealing.\n\nAlbanese gave a boilerplate answer about his passion for access to affordable childcare, a worthy goal but not in the Hawke-Keating pantheon. Dutton spoke about the centrality of affordable energy to the economy, which led to nuclear power, a policy he has barely spoken about during the campaign. Leaders go head to head in the second debate. Credit: Matt Golding First, Speers fact-checked Dutton on his regular claim that Australia is the only G20 nation that hasn\u2019t signed up to nuclear power or is already using it and Dutton pivoted to claim that Indonesian president Prabowo was \u201cfully on board\u201d with it. (The World Nuclear Association says on its website that our near neighbour has a small Russian 10MW experimental reactor planned near Jakarta, but it is delayed).\n\nQuestions followed about whether there was sufficient water to cool nuclear power stations at the Coalition\u2019s seven nominated sites \u2013 there is substantial evidence that there is not \u2013 and what type of plant would be situated where. The opposition leader did not adequately answer and that is no basis for an economy-transforming energy transition. This was a debate that exposed some of the long-term risks inherent in one of Dutton\u2019s trademarks \u2013 the slightly exaggerated verbal drive-by - and how that can catch up with you, as we saw when he had to recant his claims about Indonesian support for a Russian base. It revealed a gap between the prime minister and opposition leader in policy preparation and detail that will give some voters pause as they consider whether the Coalition really is ready to return to government. Verdict: Albanese won this debate, though not by much.\n\nPeter Dutton has put it on the record: \u201cI don\u2019t know the President. I have never met him\u2026I don\u2019t know Donald Trump\u201d. We were 40 minutes into the hour-long leaders\u2019 debate, and the tariff-fancying elephant in the room was finally acknowledged. For weeks Labor has been explicitly linking Peter Dutton to the enormously unpopular (in Australia) US president. Dutton had not yet expressly denied the allegations of intimacy. Finally, he had his chance, and he took it.\n\nAnd yet, here Dutton was, just a few minutes later, arguing that a government led by him would be better placed to negotiate an exemption to tariffs imposed by the US. Was that due to some sort of special relationship, inquired debate host David Speers. Dutton said it was based on past experience, but then he admitted to one of the most special relationships available to man - the golf buddy. \u201cWe have an ambassador with this government who can\u2019t get a phone call with the president,\u201d Dutton said. \u201cWe had an ambassador who used to play golf with him.\u201d\n\nIt was a reference to former US Ambassador Joe Hockey who famously lost many a round of golf to Trump (he must have lost, because Trump never loses). Loading It was tricky terrain, but overall Dutton performed better than he did in the Sky debate last week. He was more relaxed and on-message, particularly when speaking about the Liberal value of homeownership and its importance to family formation. The PM looked cagey on a few occasions - notably when asked, if renewables were indeed the cheapest form of energy as he claims, when would our power bills come down? Albanese had to fudge that one, but in most other instances he was better able to articulate his policies.\n\nHe was able to reassure young Australians in particular, that he believes unequivocally in the science of climate change. Dutton didn\u2019t seem so sure - which won\u2019t endear him to many voters in teal and Greens seats the Coalition needs to win back this election. Verdict: Albanese by a whisker First they neutralised each other\u2019s cost of living policies by going tit-for-tat with bribes around the budget. Now they\u2019ve neutralised housing, by offering competing ideas so similar that it takes a pen and paper to reckon through their competing merits.\n\nThis debate brought home that on these things, the two major parties have effectively cancelled each other out. No low-engagement voter is going to remember which party stands for which of the housing policies the prime minister and the opposition leader bandied about tonight. Most voters won\u2019t remember what the leaders said, but they will remember how the leaders made them feel. And on this front, the prime minister claimed the wedge. The Coalition is stuck trying to explain how its energy policy will transform the economy and make it more productive. Despite trying hard over the past few weeks to free themselves of the chains of economics, the Coalition is still in the habit of trying to pay for things. Meanwhile, Labor has a killer pitch: if you love something, they will make it free. Never mind where the money comes from. Only the opposition will cut, according to Albanese. Both leaders managed to cast a little shade on their opponent \u2013 in essence, that he is mad, bad, and dangerous to vote for. Dutton called the prime minister a liar and pointed out that his freebies will be paid for by young voters; Albanese attacked Dutton on foreign affairs and defence, undermining a key Coalition equity and seeking to reinforce the idea that Dutton is \u201cTrumpy\u201d. But there is a more important set of audiences that both leaders clearly had in mind.\n\nTheir carefully rehearsed messages provided content for a multitude of little campaign warlords, commanding a crucial booth here, an impassioned issue there, or an antsy demographic subgroup. Unions will be speaking to their audiences about affordable childcare, developers to theirs about Dutton\u2019s sledge on the CFMEU. Likewise on migration, renewable energy, nuclear, free TAFE and more \u2013 dozens of little bites to excite a handful of votes which could prove crucial. These are the groups who will move molehills in an election contested in seat-by-seat combat. And if enough molehills move together, one or the other leader will be get a leg up in \u201cclimbing a mountain\u201d, as the prime minister says, on election day. Albanese didn\u2019t perform better on the night, but he won by providing TikTok soundbites for the next fortnight of campaigning. Verdict: Albanese, for the algorithm If I really have to pick a winner, it\u2019s David Speers. Calm, firm and interrupted two endless gasbags without compunction. Loved that for us. He\u2019s grown out of his Sky News vibes and looks right at home on the national broadcaster.\n\nSpeers completely skewered Peter Dutton on nuclear energy and water use. And when the Opposition Leader spoke at a million miles an hour, Speers interjected: \u201cI\u201dm just trying to clarify your plans, Mr Dutton.\u201d If Speers gets sick of journalism, he would make a brilliant year-nine classroom teacher. Sadly, he\u2019s not in the competition so we have to pick from two middle-aged men in pastel ties. Straight into housing. They both rehearsed well enough to remember their lines. In summary, we have supply guy versus use-your-super guy. So what was memorable? Albanese\u2019s demeanour. He\u2019s transmogrified from a wet wimp into a politician comfortable name-dropping other world leaders as friends. In comparison, Dutton exuded \u201cpick me\u201d energy, talking too fast and struggling to stand up for the science. His desire to be forceful combined with his staccato delivery made him stumble a bit. Albanese seemed more relaxed, more fluent. Loading\n\nThe most startling moment of the debate? Speers asked Dutton about climate change. The Opposition Leader replied, with a straight face, \u201cI\u2019m not a scientist,\u201d though he did say he\u2019d defer to their judgment. Dear god. Both looked like liars, though. Albanese claims to trust Trump. And I got even more confused by Dutton who on one hand said he was critical of the US president\u2019s treatment of Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky but he would also do a better job of dealing with Trump. It was a head-spinning answer. I bring you this verdict replete with my own biases. I\u2019m clearly a person with progressive views but Labor disappoints me on a regular basis. The Liberal Party will always be the party which enabled and accelerated robodebt. And now we know its leader is too timid to give a full-throated endorsement of climate science. Verdict: Albanese wins. At least he recognises the science.\n\nPeter Dutton went into this debate with a clear objective: downplay the hard man and play up the pragmatist. That was evident in everything from his assured and measured speaking style to his timing. Unlike Albanese\u2019s opening and closing statements that overrode moderator David Speers\u2019 repeated attempts to enforce the time limit, Dutton kept his succinct. It showed a discipline his campaign has sometimes lacked. Another example: after erring on Tuesday by claiming Indonesia\u2019s president Prabowo Subianto had publicly confirmed reports Russia was seeking a debate in the country, Dutton admitted the mistake in the debate and moved on. He was more credible than Albanese on Trump too, saying he trusted the United States but didn\u2019t know the president. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton\n\nAlbanese, on the other hand, strained credulity to breaking point by claiming he had \u201cno reason not to\u201d trust the president, whose wildly mercurial approach to governing is obvious to anyone in possession of their senses. When Albanese insisted his government had not commissioned modelling on winding back changes to capital gains tax and negative gearing \u2014 which this masthead revealed it had in September last year \u2014 Dutton was ready to pounce. It reinforced one of his key narratives that Albanese can be loose with the truth. Of course Dutton can be too \u2014 or so evasive it\u2019s much the same thing. He lost points on climate, costings and housing. But blessed with low expectations from a couple of rough weeks on the campaign trail, Dutton came out a narrow winner.",

Loading Dutton instead brought the conversation back to Albanese\u2019s denial that he would revisit the tax breaks for investors. \u201cAnthony, your government modelled negative gearing changes and capital gains tax. The treasurer has done that,\u201d he said. Albanese shot back: \u201cThat\u2019s not right\u201d. Dutton replied: \u201cIt is right\u201d. This masthead revealed in September last year that Treasury had worked on options to scale back negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions.\n\nAsked about the modelling at the time, Treasurer Jim Chalmers said it was \u201cnot unusual at all for governments, or for treasurers, to get advice on contentious issues which are in the public domain.\u201d Balancing the budget Both parties are going into this election with billions in big spending plans. Where will the money come from? Wednesday night did not deliver an answer. Albanese tried to spruik his government\u2019s two surpluses. But given Labor\u2019s most recent budget predicts the government will spend more than it raises for the next decade, host David Speers asked why so many of the government\u2019s policies \u2013 wiping HECS debts, Medicare rebates, energy rebates \u2013 aren\u2019t means tested. \u201cThe HECS debt is about intergenerational equity. We spoke before about young people. I think young people deserve a fair crack,\u201d Albanese said in his first attempt to answer.\n\n\u201cWhen I get sick or you get sick we have access to Medicare or a hospital. Every child, Peter\u2019s or mine, will get access to a public education and school,\u201d he said in a second. \u201c[With] energy rebates, you had two choices because of the way it is delivered through the energy companies, you either give it to everyone or just to concession cardholders. We understand a whole lot of working people need that assistance in cost of living,\u201d he said in a third. But he never gave a clear answer about the principle of giving cost-of-living relief to wealthy people, which is what Speers asked three times. Dutton\u2019s grilling came a few moments later. First, he was asked if his public service cuts \u2013 eventually worth $7 billion a year \u2013 would cover all the Coalition\u2019s spending. To that, Dutton gave a straight answer. \u201cThe short answer is no,\u201d he said. \u201cWe won\u2019t achieve all of the savings we need to achieve through our changes to the public service.\u201d\n\nBut the clarity did not last long. Dutton was asked three times which part of the public service he would cut. He did not say. He was asked twice if foreign aid would be cut. He did not say. Cuts would come \u201cwhere we find inefficiency,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something you can do from opposition to redesign the public service in the way that works.\u201d Energy and climate change Labor\u2019s ill-fated promise from before the 2022 election to bring power bills down $275 by this year has haunted the government. Albanese refused to walk into any kind of commitment like that on Wednesday night. Three times he was asked: \u201cWhen will we see our power bills come down?\u201d Albanese demurred. \u201cWhat we need to do is to roll out renewables, make sure there\u2019s energy security, make sure it\u2019s backed up by batteries, by hydro and by gas,\u201d he said, in one of several attempts at answering, but never delivered a timeline.",

        "content": "Dr Kim Sawyer discusses Australia's political duopoly and why our first voting preferences matter.\n\nWE ARE TRAPPED in an oligopoly \u2014 not the supermarkets, banks, the media or social media platforms but the duopoly of two political parties where our last preference is often more important than our first.\n\nFor many, the last preference on May 3 is a choice between an \"F\" and an \"F-minus\".\n\nIn 1929, mathematical statistician Harold Hotelling identified a fundamental principle of oligopoly: the principle of minimum differentiation, or Hotelling's Law. There is an incentive to make new products like the old ones and make small changes, which seem like improvements but not too much change so as to frighten the horses.\n\nHotelling observed what we can all observe. Oligopolists behave like monopolists; not only Coles and Woolworths with their weekly specials, not only petrol stations located at the same intersection but also, political parties in their platforms.\n\nHotelling wrote his essay nearly a century ago, but his observations are relevant today. Politicians compete for the marginal voter who is often indifferent to significant reform.\n\nOver the past 50 years, we have observed a shift in Australian politics away from the two major parties that is best measured by the combined two-party primary vote at the Federal elections.\n\nIn 1972, Labor won the election with 49.59% of the primary vote, the Coalition got 41.48% \u2014 the two-party primary vote was more than 90%. The two-party vote still exceeded 85% in the 1996 Election of the Howard Government and in the 2007 Election of the Rudd Government.\n\nHowever, the two-party vote began to erode soon after as Greens and independents emerged. In 2022, Labor\u2019s vote was 32.58%, the Coalition\u2019s 35.7%, a combined vote of less than 70%, more than 20% below that in 1972.\n\nOpinion polls suggest that it will be the same on May 3. Australians are moving away from the two main parties\u2026 at least with their first preference. They recognise that the minor parties, not the major parties, are the agents of reform.\n\nThe two main parties have become as risk-averse as the marginal voters for whom they compete. They have lost the appetite for the reforms of the Whitlam and Hawke-Keating governments. Labor and the Coalition now share too much of the same DNA to reform what should be reformed. Labor, the party of reform, has been burnt by history.\n\nThere is no better example than taxation. We need a simpler, fairer, more efficient tax system with fewer deductions that addresses the problem of income and wealth inequality, and addresses anomalies. But there are too many lobbyists and vested interests for this to happen.\n\nA tax summit would be a start, but Labor has learned the lesson that taxation reform is risky. In 1985, the Hawke Government abolished negative gearing for future rental property investors. By 1987 it was reversed after lobbying from realtors. At the 2019 Election, Labor promised to halve the 50% capital gains tax deduction and limit negative gearing to new properties only. Labor was burnt at the election. Labor has reversed this policy.\n\nThere is no better example of an opportunity lost than the failure to adopt the Henry tax reforms. The Henry tax review commissioned by the Rudd Government made 138 recommendations, a simpler, fairer tax system that included a higher tax-free threshold with only two tax brackets, increases in rent assistance, uniform land tax and removal of stamp duty.\n\nOf the 138 recommendations, the Rudd Government went with only four, the most contentious of which was the resource rent tax, the mining tax, levied at a rate of 40%. It was the mining tax that brought out the vested interests. It was the mining tax that brought the tax review undone. If only the Government had adopted the whole blueprint.\n\nThere is a sclerosis in our politics that I have observed over many years of political activism. The sclerosis is attributable to the indifference of the two major parties to meaningful reform.\n\nIn 1994, I appeared before the first Senate Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing. There were 39 recommendations including the establishment of a public interest disclosure agency. It was never enabled, and it took 20 years before whistleblowing legislation was enacted. Whistleblowers have paid the price. The prosecution of David McBride and the failure to prosecute those who have retaliated against whistleblowers is the price of tokenism.\n\nThe 1994 Senate Committee also recommended the establishment of a banking ombudsman. It was never enabled; instead, Australians who have complaints about banks must complain to the Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA), which is funded by the very banks that it judges. Unsurprisingly, according to its own data, AFCA has ordered banks to fully reimburse scam victims in only 4.8% of cases \u2014 and only small cases. AFCA is not a traditional ombudsman.\n\nAnd it is the same in higher education. The 2001 Senate Inquiry into Higher Education recommended establishing a university ombudsman. The ombudsman was never established. The imperative was not strong enough.\n\nNonetheless, the imperative is strong enough when the major parties want. The 2024 Senate inquiry into Lobbying found that the major parties did not want to restrict lobbying, despite there being 15 paid lobbyists for each parliamentarian on any day in Parliament House.\n\nIndependent Senator David Pocock dissented. He recommended that the lobbying code be legislated to include interactions between lobbyists and all parliamentarians with penalties for breaches, and for an independent regulator to be appointed. Pocock was representing the interest of the unpaid lobbyists who the paid lobbyists subvert. Pocock was representing the public interest.\n\nWhile last preferences of voters may matter more in determining the government after May 3, the first preferences matter more in the long term. The first preferences are the agents of reform.\n\nDr Kim Sawyer is a senior fellow in the School of Historical and Philosophical Studies at the University of Melbourne.",

This policy is perhaps one of the biggest failures in Australian history.\u201d\n\nAustralia\u2019s tobacco policy also received a dishonourable mention in the 2025 Federal Budget with the revelation that the fall in the sale of legal cigarettes had led to a precipitous decline in the tobacco excise that was projected to blow a $10 billion hole in the Budget\u2019s prediction of revenue collected over the next four years. The tobacco tax peaked at $16.8 billion in 2019, declined to $10 billion in 2023 and was projected to fall to $6.4 billion in 2028.\n\nFor comparison, the money required for supplementary funding to increase our Medicare billing rates over the next four years was estimated at $8.5 billion.\n\nCommenting on the tobacco tax decline in the Australian Financial Review, economist Chris Richardson labelled Australia\u2019s tobacco tax a $10 billion policy mistake that has fuelled organised crime and worsened health outcomes.\n\nRichardson condemned the absurd increase in tobacco tax:\n\nThe politicians got greedy and tobacco taxes are already up by more than a factor of five since 2010. However, Australia has raised tobacco taxes so far and so fast that we\u2019ve spawned a vast black market. The tax take is telling us that Australians jumped into the black market. That\u2019s been a godsend for criminals. This is a market that is just as profitable as heroin, but with a fraction of the legal consequences if you\u2019re caught.\n\nChris Richardson was largely correct, except that putting a heavy tax on smoking was done for two reasons: to raise revenue, as he said, but secondly to discourage people from smoking. When the health authorities saw the excise was down, they misinterpreted the data as proof that their tax policies were working, but wishful thinking is never a good basis for policy. The wastewater testing (below) showed the nicotine was still there, but it was masked by the black market.\n\nThe chief executive of the AACS, Theo Foukkare, called on the Federal Government to freeze the excise on tobacco products for four years, along with legalising and regulating smoking cessation tools such as vapes, and strengthening the crackdown on illegal tobacco:\n\n\u201cThe definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome. The Government, with their policy around tobacco excise and vaping prohibition, is doing exactly that. If it is revenue that the Government is after, it should legalise and tax cannabis.\u201d\n\nThe two sides of the nicotine debate\n\n\u2018...raising tobacco taxes is one of the most effective mechanisms for governments to reduce population consumption of tobacco.\u2019 ~ \u2018Tobacco in Australia\u2019, Australian Department of Health.\n\nAustralia\u2019s road to tobacco policy hell was paved with the very best of intentions, to reduce the consumption of tobacco, so how did it go so wrong?\n\nSince the Health Department regarded price as the best way to reduce tobacco use, it adopted the crazy policy of increasing the tobacco tax by 12.5% every year, starting in 2013 and ending in 2021. In 2023, in his second budget, Treasurer Jim Chalmers announced a further 15% increase in the tobacco tax, estimating it would bring in an extra $3.3 billion over the next three years.\n\nAs the graph indicates, the Treasurer\u2019s prediction was out by about minus ten billion dollars, which shows how woefully ignorant our Treasurer is about how excise tax works.\n\nFor Bay FM, I interviewed Dr Alex Wodak, the tobacco harm reduction adviser to the Harm Reduction Australia Board, who explained excise tax in a way even Jim Chalmers might understand:\n\n\u201cEconomists talk about a Laffer curve. This occurs when trying to estimate what the optimal taxation rate for a commodity is. If the taxation rate is too low, government revenue is not optimised because the rate is too low. If it is too high, government revenue falls away and there is widespread noncompliance, and people go to the black market. That's the situation we are in with cigarette taxation in Australia.\u201d\n\nHarm reduction relies on helping consumers choose safer methods of consumption. Unlike prohibitionists, harm reductionists avoid a judgemental approach to drug taking or drug takers but seek to educate consumers about how to avoid harms.\n\nLung cancer is a major cause of death for tobacco smokers, but this results from inhaling the tars caused by burning tobacco, not from the nicotine. So the harm reduction approach is to encourage other means of consumption like vaping, which is inhaling nicotine aerosols, nicotine patches and so on.\n\nProfessor Simon Chapman is arguably the chief architect of Australia\u2019s disastrous tobacco policies. Interviewed by Four Corners, he argued against reducing the tobacco tax, asserting that big tobacco exaggerates the size of the black market.\n\nChapman said:\n\n\u201cWe have a principle called the scream test. Basically, this means that if you follow the media monitors and follow what the tobacco companies are saying, if they are screaming very loud you know that is a policy that is going to bite hard on their bottom line and the things that they have screamed loudest about throughout my career is probably tax number one.\u201d\n\nDan Oakes then asked Simon Chapman the question many were pleased he did:\n\n\u201cYou have a deep-seated hatred of big tobacco. Do you think this risks blinding you to what people are saying in good faith?\u201d\n\nChapman replied, dismissing sincere experts like Rohan Pike and Dr Alex Wodak with this insult:\n\n\u201cI think they should look in the mirror and see that what they are asking for is exactly the same as what Big Tobacco is asking for. Political useful idiots.\u201d\n\nIn our interview, Dr Wodak replied, not with an ad hominin attack, but with a policy-based disagreement:\n\nAustralia's response to tobacco since 2010, more and more resembles the way Australia and many other countries have responded to the war on drugs with extremism \u2014 with the intentional provision of misinformation and disinformation, refusal to have any discussion or debate in public or even in private with people who disagree with that policy, extreme hubris. Really, the long and the short of it is that Australia's response to tobacco since about 2010 has looked more and more like a war on nicotine.\n\nIn their commentary in the Australian Harm Reduction Journal, James Martin and Edward Jegasothy agreed with Dr Wodak, arguing that Australia\u2019s intensified regulatory approach toward nicotine control revealed a shift that increasingly resembles a de facto war on nicotine.\n\nMartin and Jegasothy wrote:\n\n\u2018...recent policies \u2013 including increased tobacco taxation and a ban on consumer vapes \u2013 have inadvertently fuelled a burgeoning nicotine black market. This has resulted in serious unintended consequences, including increased criminal activity, systemic violence and health risks associated with the proliferation of unregulated nicotine products.\u2019\n\nThe combination of sky-high cigarette prices and the Health Department\u2019s overwhelming obsession with cutting smoking rates had combined in a perfect storm to fuel an explosion in Australia\u2019s tobacco black market. Our tobacco policies were creating more harm than they mitigated, mirroring many of the unintended consequences historically associated with drug prohibition.\n\nDan Oakes also interviewed Health Minister Mark Butler and asked if the Government would consider pausing tobacco tax increases to freeze legal prices and starve the black market of customers.\n\nEchoing Simon Chapman, he replied that this was something the tobacco industry lobbied for, but that would be \u201craising the white flag\u201d and letting criminals and the industry dictate government policy.\n\nHowever, he could not deny that organised crime was already controlling the market:\n\n\u201cWell, that's right, they've been able to get a foothold and I regret that that's the case, but, you know, the best time to deal with this would've been five years ago. The second-best time is to deal with it now.\u201d\n\nRohan Pike disagreed. The best time was a decade ago when he alerted Border Force and the Government to the problem, but denial reigned then as it does now, and his warnings were ignored. Mark Butler\u2019s solution was too little and too late. The black market was so widespread and entrenched that average citizens no longer had any qualms about participating in the black market.\n\nPike said:\n\n\u201cGiven that excise rates are the primary driver of this problem, from the start we should be looking at reducing the excise rates to a level that doesn't encourage people to go to the illicit market.\u201d\n\nHealth's response to the rise of vaping\n\nCould Australia\u2019s disastrous tobacco policy possibly get any worse?\n\nGiven the geniuses we have running the Health Department, this proved no problem.\n\nAllow me to illustrate:\n\nThis is a graphic from the article titled Analysis of wastewater from 2013 to 2021 detected a recent increase in nicotine use in Queensland, Australia. It plots the levels of nicotine measured between 2013 and 2021 in a wastewater treatment plant serving over 100,000 people in southeast Queensland.\n\nTracing different metabolites, one measuring tobacco-based nicotine use from cigarettes, the other measuring non-tobacco nicotine use from vapes, nicotine patches and other nicotine replacement therapies, it shows the transformation in nicotine consumption between 2013 and 2021 as e-cigarettes or vapes replaced cigarette use. Vapes are recommended as safer than cigarettes because they are free from the tars released by burning tobacco, the major cause of lung cancer in tobacco smokers.\n\nThe graph shows how nicotine users\u2019 concerns about lung cancer changed the pattern of nicotine use in Australia. However, the rise of vapes worried the nicotine prohibitionists in the Health Department, and they set about banning vapes and successfully driving vapes, which are comparable in size to the cigarette market, into the black market as well.\n\nNicotine vapes were made harder to obtain with an \u2018enhanced regulatory approach to vaping\u2019, according to the 2023 Budget Papers, which required vape users to obtain a prescription from their doctor to legally obtain vapes. Fruity flavours and colourful packaging were also abolished to make vapes less appealing.\n\nOverwhelmingly, this caused vapers to shift to the black market. The National Drug Strategy Household Survey 2022\u20132023 reported that 1.8 million Australians smoked tobacco, while 1.5 million used vapes, a figure that had tripled from 2019. A vast majority (87%) of people who had used e\u2011cigarettes with nicotine reported that they had obtained them without a prescription (from the black market).\n\nSaid Dr Wodak:\n\nWe have a policy rigidity problem with vaping. The customers, the people who vape, have gone to the black market. The problem with that is they're getting unregulated vapes over which governments have no control, so it it's a failed and futile policy which is unsustainable and sooner or later, I hope, the policy will collapse and the Government will have to introduce a much more realistic policy both for cigarette excise but also for vaping.\n\nOur interview ended with this bizarrely contrarian observation from Dr Wodak who said:\n\nIt is a curious situation that we're in, that we have to be grateful to the black market \u2013 run, of course, by criminals \u2013 but we have to be grateful to the criminals and for the black market that they have helped to accelerate the decline in smoking and switch people who enjoy nicotine to help them switch from high risk deadly cigarettes to low risk, safer vaping. So it's the criminals who have provided the market for people who want to keep on using nicotine.\n\nDr John Jiggens is a writer and journalist currently working in the community newsroom at Bay-FM in Byron Bay.",

        "content": "By the end of the hour, Albanese seemed more assured. Dutton did not get the victory he wanted, at the very point he needed to lift his campaign. Verdict: Albanese In the first 2025 election debate, Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton fought each other to a nil-all draw, and viewers were the losers. What a difference a week can make. This was a serious debate and one in which both leaders gave unconvincing answers to detailed questions.\n\nHousing opened the debate. Albanese focused on his government\u2019s own policy proposals whereas Dutton started by criticising Labor before Speers asked about the regressive nature of his signature housing policy. Dutton did not give a convincing answer when asked about the policy\u2019s lack of fairness, while neither man gave an answer that will satisfy anyone who wants negative gearing and capital gains tax breaks scaled back. Key moments in the second debate Credit: ABC Pool Both said no changes are planned, but Albanese didn\u2019t sound believable when asked whether negative gearing changes had been modelled by Treasury. \u201cIt certainly wasn\u2019t commissioned by us\u201d is not a convincing answer. There were questions on the economy, Indigenous disadvantage, Donald Trump and foreign policy. But it was when the two men were asked what big political reform they would like to be remembered for that the debate was most revealing.\n\nAlbanese gave a boilerplate answer about his passion for access to affordable childcare, a worthy goal but not in the Hawke-Keating pantheon. Dutton spoke about the centrality of affordable energy to the economy, which led to nuclear power, a policy he has barely spoken about during the campaign. Leaders go head to head in the second debate. Credit: Matt Golding First, Speers fact-checked Dutton on his regular claim that Australia is the only G20 nation that hasn\u2019t signed up to nuclear power or is already using it and Dutton pivoted to claim that Indonesian president Prabowo was \u201cfully on board\u201d with it. (The World Nuclear Association says on its website that our near neighbour has a small Russian 10MW experimental reactor planned near Jakarta, but it is delayed).\n\nQuestions followed about whether there was sufficient water to cool nuclear power stations at the Coalition\u2019s seven nominated sites \u2013 there is substantial evidence that there is not \u2013 and what type of plant would be situated where. The opposition leader did not adequately answer and that is no basis for an economy-transforming energy transition. This was a debate that exposed some of the long-term risks inherent in one of Dutton\u2019s trademarks \u2013 the slightly exaggerated verbal drive-by - and how that can catch up with you, as we saw when he had to recant his claims about Indonesian support for a Russian base. It revealed a gap between the prime minister and opposition leader in policy preparation and detail that will give some voters pause as they consider whether the Coalition really is ready to return to government. Verdict: Albanese won this debate, though not by much.\n\nPeter Dutton has put it on the record: \u201cI don\u2019t know the President. I have never met him\u2026I don\u2019t know Donald Trump\u201d. We were 40 minutes into the hour-long leaders\u2019 debate, and the tariff-fancying elephant in the room was finally acknowledged. For weeks Labor has been explicitly linking Peter Dutton to the enormously unpopular (in Australia) US president. Dutton had not yet expressly denied the allegations of intimacy. Finally, he had his chance, and he took it.\n\nAnd yet, here Dutton was, just a few minutes later, arguing that a government led by him would be better placed to negotiate an exemption to tariffs imposed by the US. Was that due to some sort of special relationship, inquired debate host David Speers. Dutton said it was based on past experience, but then he admitted to one of the most special relationships available to man - the golf buddy. \u201cWe have an ambassador with this government who can\u2019t get a phone call with the president,\u201d Dutton said. \u201cWe had an ambassador who used to play golf with him.\u201d\n\nIt was a reference to former US Ambassador Joe Hockey who famously lost many a round of golf to Trump (he must have lost, because Trump never loses). Loading It was tricky terrain, but overall Dutton performed better than he did in the Sky debate last week. He was more relaxed and on-message, particularly when speaking about the Liberal value of homeownership and its importance to family formation. The PM looked cagey on a few occasions - notably when asked, if renewables were indeed the cheapest form of energy as he claims, when would our power bills come down? Albanese had to fudge that one, but in most other instances he was better able to articulate his policies.\n\nHe was able to reassure young Australians in particular, that he believes unequivocally in the science of climate change. Dutton didn\u2019t seem so sure - which won\u2019t endear him to many voters in teal and Greens seats the Coalition needs to win back this election. Verdict: Albanese by a whisker First they neutralised each other\u2019s cost of living policies by going tit-for-tat with bribes around the budget. Now they\u2019ve neutralised housing, by offering competing ideas so similar that it takes a pen and paper to reckon through their competing merits.\n\nThis debate brought home that on these things, the two major parties have effectively cancelled each other out. No low-engagement voter is going to remember which party stands for which of the housing policies the prime minister and the opposition leader bandied about tonight. Most voters won\u2019t remember what the leaders said, but they will remember how the leaders made them feel. And on this front, the prime minister claimed the wedge. The Coalition is stuck trying to explain how its energy policy will transform the economy and make it more productive. Despite trying hard over the past few weeks to free themselves of the chains of economics, the Coalition is still in the habit of trying to pay for things. Meanwhile, Labor has a killer pitch: if you love something, they will make it free. Never mind where the money comes from. Only the opposition will cut, according to Albanese. Both leaders managed to cast a little shade on their opponent \u2013 in essence, that he is mad, bad, and dangerous to vote for. Dutton called the prime minister a liar and pointed out that his freebies will be paid for by young voters; Albanese attacked Dutton on foreign affairs and defence, undermining a key Coalition equity and seeking to reinforce the idea that Dutton is \u201cTrumpy\u201d. But there is a more important set of audiences that both leaders clearly had in mind.\n\nTheir carefully rehearsed messages provided content for a multitude of little campaign warlords, commanding a crucial booth here, an impassioned issue there, or an antsy demographic subgroup. Unions will be speaking to their audiences about affordable childcare, developers to theirs about Dutton\u2019s sledge on the CFMEU. Likewise on migration, renewable energy, nuclear, free TAFE and more \u2013 dozens of little bites to excite a handful of votes which could prove crucial. These are the groups who will move molehills in an election contested in seat-by-seat combat. And if enough molehills move together, one or the other leader will be get a leg up in \u201cclimbing a mountain\u201d, as the prime minister says, on election day. Albanese didn\u2019t perform better on the night, but he won by providing TikTok soundbites for the next fortnight of campaigning. Verdict: Albanese, for the algorithm If I really have to pick a winner, it\u2019s David Speers. Calm, firm and interrupted two endless gasbags without compunction. Loved that for us. He\u2019s grown out of his Sky News vibes and looks right at home on the national broadcaster.\n\nSpeers completely skewered Peter Dutton on nuclear energy and water use. And when the Opposition Leader spoke at a million miles an hour, Speers interjected: \u201cI\u201dm just trying to clarify your plans, Mr Dutton.\u201d If Speers gets sick of journalism, he would make a brilliant year-nine classroom teacher. Sadly, he\u2019s not in the competition so we have to pick from two middle-aged men in pastel ties. Straight into housing. They both rehearsed well enough to remember their lines. In summary, we have supply guy versus use-your-super guy. So what was memorable? Albanese\u2019s demeanour. He\u2019s transmogrified from a wet wimp into a politician comfortable name-dropping other world leaders as friends. In comparison, Dutton exuded \u201cpick me\u201d energy, talking too fast and struggling to stand up for the science. His desire to be forceful combined with his staccato delivery made him stumble a bit. Albanese seemed more relaxed, more fluent. Loading\n\nThe most startling moment of the debate? Speers asked Dutton about climate change. The Opposition Leader replied, with a straight face, \u201cI\u2019m not a scientist,\u201d though he did say he\u2019d defer to their judgment. Dear god. Both looked like liars, though. Albanese claims to trust Trump. And I got even more confused by Dutton who on one hand said he was critical of the US president\u2019s treatment of Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky but he would also do a better job of dealing with Trump. It was a head-spinning answer. I bring you this verdict replete with my own biases. I\u2019m clearly a person with progressive views but Labor disappoints me on a regular basis. The Liberal Party will always be the party which enabled and accelerated robodebt. And now we know its leader is too timid to give a full-throated endorsement of climate science. Verdict: Albanese wins. At least he recognises the science.\n\nPeter Dutton went into this debate with a clear objective: downplay the hard man and play up the pragmatist. That was evident in everything from his assured and measured speaking style to his timing. Unlike Albanese\u2019s opening and closing statements that overrode moderator David Speers\u2019 repeated attempts to enforce the time limit, Dutton kept his succinct. It showed a discipline his campaign has sometimes lacked. Another example: after erring on Tuesday by claiming Indonesia\u2019s president Prabowo Subianto had publicly confirmed reports Russia was seeking a debate in the country, Dutton admitted the mistake in the debate and moved on. He was more credible than Albanese on Trump too, saying he trusted the United States but didn\u2019t know the president. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton\n\nAlbanese, on the other hand, strained credulity to breaking point by claiming he had \u201cno reason not to\u201d trust the president, whose wildly mercurial approach to governing is obvious to anyone in possession of their senses. When Albanese insisted his government had not commissioned modelling on winding back changes to capital gains tax and negative gearing \u2014 which this masthead revealed it had in September last year \u2014 Dutton was ready to pounce. It reinforced one of his key narratives that Albanese can be loose with the truth. Of course Dutton can be too \u2014 or so evasive it\u2019s much the same thing. He lost points on climate, costings and housing. But blessed with low expectations from a couple of rough weeks on the campaign trail, Dutton came out a narrow winner.",

        "content": "But nobody gave a straight answer when Speers asked whether people should be able to use tax breaks to buy four, five or six properties. Loading Dutton instead brought the conversation back to Albanese\u2019s denial that he would revisit the tax breaks for investors. \u201cAnthony, your government modelled negative gearing changes and capital gains tax. The treasurer has done that,\u201d he said. Albanese shot back: \u201cThat\u2019s not right\u201d. Dutton replied: \u201cIt is right\u201d. This masthead revealed in September last year that Treasury had worked on options to scale back negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions.\n\nAsked about the modelling at the time, Treasurer Jim Chalmers said it was \u201cnot unusual at all for governments, or for treasurers, to get advice on contentious issues which are in the public domain.\u201d Balancing the budget Both parties are going into this election with billions in big spending plans. Where will the money come from? Wednesday night did not deliver an answer. Albanese tried to spruik his government\u2019s two surpluses. But given Labor\u2019s most recent budget predicts the government will spend more than it raises for the next decade, host David Speers asked why so many of the government\u2019s policies \u2013 wiping HECS debts, Medicare rebates, energy rebates \u2013 aren\u2019t means tested. \u201cThe HECS debt is about intergenerational equity. We spoke before about young people. I think young people deserve a fair crack,\u201d Albanese said in his first attempt to answer.\n\n\u201cWhen I get sick or you get sick we have access to Medicare or a hospital. Every child, Peter\u2019s or mine, will get access to a public education and school,\u201d he said in a second. \u201c[With] energy rebates, you had two choices because of the way it is delivered through the energy companies, you either give it to everyone or just to concession cardholders. We understand a whole lot of working people need that assistance in cost of living,\u201d he said in a third. But he never gave a clear answer about the principle of giving cost-of-living relief to wealthy people, which is what Speers asked three times. Dutton\u2019s grilling came a few moments later. First, he was asked if his public service cuts \u2013 eventually worth $7 billion a year \u2013 would cover all the Coalition\u2019s spending. To that, Dutton gave a straight answer. \u201cThe short answer is no,\u201d he said. \u201cWe won\u2019t achieve all of the savings we need to achieve through our changes to the public service.\u201d\n\nBut the clarity did not last long. Dutton was asked three times which part of the public service he would cut. He did not say. He was asked twice if foreign aid would be cut. He did not say. Cuts would come \u201cwhere we find inefficiency,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something you can do from opposition to redesign the public service in the way that works.\u201d Energy and climate change Labor\u2019s ill-fated promise from before the 2022 election to bring power bills down $275 by this year has haunted the government. Albanese refused to walk into any kind of commitment like that on Wednesday night. Three times he was asked: \u201cWhen will we see our power bills come down?\u201d Albanese demurred. \u201cWhat we need to do is to roll out renewables, make sure there\u2019s energy security, make sure it\u2019s backed up by batteries, by hydro and by gas,\u201d he said, in one of several attempts at answering, but never delivered a timeline.",

ST PHOTO: MARK CHEONG\n\nPM Wong on relations with big powers, US tariffs and the future of the greenback\n\nSINGAPORE \u2013 Singapore\u2019s foreign policy approach is to have many best friends, including the US, China and Europe, and the city state does not want a world where it can have only one friend, said Prime Minister Lawrence Wong at a dialogue after he delivered the 14th S. Rajaratnam Lecture on April 16.\n\nIn a transcript released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, PM Wong answered questions that ranged from managing relations with the US and China, to the role Singaporeans can play in the nation\u2019s foreign policy.\n\nManaging relations with the US and with China\n\nSingapore wants to stay good friends with both the US and China, and wants both countries to be actively engaged in the region, said PM Wong.\n\nEven as Washington becomes more focused on its \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda, the US still has many significant interests in the region, and Singapore wants to help the US understand its interests and anchor its presence here.\n\nThis is because an American retreat from this region would be dangerous for the neighbourhood and Singapore, he added.\n\nSingapore likewise has close ties with China, including significant government-to-government projects such as those in Suzhou, Tianjin and Chongqing.\n\nAll this cooperation is built on a strong foundation of people-to-people ties, and the Republic wants to further develop its relations with China.\n\nBut advancing relations with both powers will get harder, not just for Singapore but also for many other countries. It will take agility, vigilance and skilful diplomacy to avoid being squeezed by both sides, said PM Wong.\n\nThis is not just on the part of the Government \u2013 the wider society, including the media, businesses and academia, must also be principled and act in Singapore\u2019s interest. This is the best way for the country to maintain its diplomatic space, he added.\n\nImpact of US tariffs on Asean\n\nSingapore takes no comfort from being spared the full brunt of the US\u2019 tariffs, as its exports are linked to supply chains in the region and China.\n\nMany of the Republic\u2019s products are value-added in factories across China and Asean before they are shipped to the US, said PM Wong.\n\nAsean economic ministers discussed the issue and decided against retaliatory tariffs, which would have hurt the region more, he added. While Asean countries will continue to engage the US individually, the grouping also plans to speak to the US collectively.\n\nIf there is a silver lining, it is that Asean now has added motivation to strengthen its regional economic integration. This includes making it easier for companies to operate seamlessly within Asean, which will make the region more competitive, said PM Wong.\n\nA more unified Asean will have a stronger voice, and increase its influence over how global developments unfold. All Asean countries recognise this, and that is why there are renewed efforts to deepen integration, he added.\n\nUS dollar to stay as global reserve currency in the medium term\n\nWhile countries will try to diversify away from the US dollar, it will remain the world\u2019s reserve currency in the near to medium term as no other alternative exists today.\n\nCountries will hedge and use local currencies for transactions, but there is a limit to how far that is practical, which is why the US dollar will retain this role for business transactions for the foreseeable future, noted PM Wong.\n\nHowever, if US banks and the US dollar are increasingly used as instruments of statecraft to advance American policy, then countries around the world will only accelerate their efforts to develop diversification options, he said.\n\nHe noted that the US dollar and US markets, traditionally a safe harbour in an uncertain world, have experienced a shift, and that the risk premium on even the US has increased.\n\nNo one knows what will happen in the coming years if more uncertainty emerges from the US that may potentially destabilise the financial markets. That is why Singapore\u2019s investment entities continue to diversify globally and never put all their eggs in one basket, said PM Wong.\n\nWhy S\u2019poreans must unite on foreign policy\n\nIt is already very hard for Singapore, as a little red dot, to make an impact in this very dangerous and fragmented world, but it will be even more challenging if people within the country are not united on a national position to engage the world, said PM Wong.\n\nThis calls for more active engagement between the Government and the people, so that Singaporeans understand issues from a national standpoint, and rally together when a foreign policy decision is made, he added.\n\nInterestingly, noted PM Wong, the new external environment has resulted in greater interest among various segments of the population on issues such as tariffs and foreign policy when the Government holds dialogues, such as in universities.\n\nThis is because Singaporeans see what is happening around the world and know instinctively that something different is happening today, said PM Wong.\n\nGiven the interest from the public, the Government will do more to engage different groups and help Singaporeans understand what is at stake, he said.\n\nJoin ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.",

He ran on the Reform Party\u2019s ticket in 2011 and 2015, and was a candidate with the Singapore People\u2019s Party in 2020.\n\nEntrepreneur and author Liyana Dhamirah, 38, was an RDU candidate for Jurong GRC in the 2020 General Election.\n\nThe five-member team is rounded out by contemporary artist Ben Puah, 48; marketing agency director Marcus Neo, 33; and principal software engineer Harish Mohanadas, 39.\n\nRDU will also contest the Jurong Central single seat, fielding piano teacher Emily Woo, 59, in the SMC. Madam Woo, who joined the party in 2020, was a teacher with the Ministry of Education and has been teaching the piano since 2000.\n\nRed Dot United will contest the Jurong Central single seat, fielding piano teacher Emily Woo in the SMC. ST PHOTO: GAVIN FOO\n\nRDU secretary-general Ravi Philemon introduced the party\u2019s candidates at a press conference held at 255 Jurong East Street 24, near Jurong-Clementi Town Council.\n\nMr Philemon said those being fielded in both constituencies are the party\u2019s \u201cfirst-choice candidates\u201d.\n\nThey were selected by the election committee after studying the demographics of the area, and not through \u201ctikam tikam\u201d \u2013 \u201crandomly picked\u201d in Malay \u2013 or frivolous thinking, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve walked the ground the past five years, you know the demographics of the people who live in this constituency. And so we can make a good decision when it comes to fielding candidates,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have done our work, we think we have a good chance. We think these constituencies are winnable.\u201d\n\nIn the 2020 General Election, RDU, then the youngest political party, contested only Jurong GRC.\n\nMr Philemon said there is a \u201cGeylang Serai of the west\u201d near Jurong East-Bukit Batok GRC, and the constituency has a fairly large number of Malay/Muslim voters.\n\nAccording to a Straits Times analysis of demographic data, 15.3 per cent of the resident population there are Malays, higher than the national average of 13.5 per cent.\n\nIntroducing Mr Osman and Ms Liyana as the \u201canchor candidates\u201d for the team, Mr Philemon said: \u201cWe acknowledge the Government has done a lot for the Malay/Muslim community, but in some areas... we can do more.\u201d\n\nMr Osman, who is based in the Philippines, is prepared to return and be based in Singapore if elected, said Mr Philemon. \u201cThat is the kind of commitment he brings to the residents here,\u201d he added.\n\nMs Liyana, who has overcome many struggles to become an entrepreneur, said she wants to champion issues close to the Malay/Muslim community.\n\nMr Harish, who is a central executive council member of RDU, is a former civil engineer with over a decade of experience in Singapore\u2019s built environment sector.\n\nHe said the rising cost of living is hitting those who struggle the most, from the elderly to low-income families. He added that, if elected, he hopes to ensure that Singapore\u2019s success is shared by all Singaporeans.\n\nMr Neo is the director of a boutique agency that serves law firms.\n\nMr Puah, whose works are part of major public and private collections, including those of the Singapore Art Museum and the National Institute of Education, joined RDU in 2024.\n\nThe core of the new Jurong East-Bukit Batok GRC comes from Jurong GRC, and it will also absorb all of Bukit Batok SMC and parts of Yuhua SMC and Hong Kah North SMC.\n\nThe RDU team will be up against a PAP team led by Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu, the incumbent MP for Yuhua.\n\nBesides Ms Fu, 61, the other two incumbents are Minister of State for Law and Transport Murali Pillai, 57, and Minister of State for Health and Digital Development and Information Rahayu Mahzam, 44.\n\nPolitical newcomer David Hoe, 37, and Mr Lee Hong Chuang, 54, who was the PAP\u2019s candidate for Hougang SMC in the 2015 and 2020 elections, round out the PAP\u2019s slate for Jurong East-Bukit Batok GRC.\n\nAt the new Jurong Central SMC, carved out as a single seat from Jurong GRC with changes to the electoral boundaries, RDU\u2019s Madam Woo will be up against incumbent and first-term MP Xie Yao Quan, 40.\n\nMadam Woo, who is a Jurong resident of over 20 years, said she has noticed municipal issues in the area , such as abandoned shopping carts, shaky lamp posts, peeling paint and littering.\n\n\u201cUnder RDU, if we are elected, we will do our best to ensure the littering problem is eradicated, and we will do our best to win the trust and confidence of the local constituents,\u201d she said.\n\nFor the 2025 General Election, the party has introduced potential candidates for Nee Soon GRC and Holland-Bukit Timah GRC, and previously indicated interest in contesting Jalan Kayu SMC, Tanjong Pagar GRC and Radin Mas SMC.\n\nJoin ST's WhatsApp Channel and get the latest news and must-reads.",

I think it's the responsibility of the government as well to keep it possible for people to buy a new car.\"\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump's 25 per cent tariffs on imported vehicles have rocked automakers in and outside of the U.S., most of which have become reliant on imports from Mexico and Canada.\n\nThe average transaction price of a vehicle in the U.S. \"is north of $48,000,\" according to an analysis from Cox Automotive. The firm expects tariffs will add 10 per cent to 15 per cent to prices of affected models, and an overall 5 per cent jump in prices of vehicles not subject to the levies.\n\nAmong the models most affected by tariffs are those priced under $30,000, almost all of which are produced outside the United States. Nissan's Versa, which Cox said has an average transaction price of about $20,000, is made in Mexico.\n\n\u201cWith the tariff coming through, it's going to be super difficult,\" Meunier said. \"The risk is that these (affordable) segments are going to disappear.\u201d\n\nWhile it could be possible for Nissan to build less costly vehicles in the U.S. instead of Mexico, Meunier said it \"would be a challenge if we're not allowed to bring some parts from Mexico.\"\n\nAutomakers are also facing tariffs on a variety of important auto parts starting May 3, including engines, transmissions, lithium-ion batteries and other major components.\n\nThe Nissan executive said the Japanese automaker has the space to expand production in the U.S. The carmaker has 800,000-unit capacity at its two U.S. auto assembly plants, and produced about 525,000 vehicles in the 2024 calendar year.\n\nStill, he said Nissan is not reducing production capacity in Mexico.\n\n\"We will accept to pay tariffs for a period of time and see how we can maneuver. We'll have potentially to adjust along the way, but we'll be very careful, because ultimately, it's very important that we keep sales momentum.\"",

        "content": "[SINGAPORE] The Republic\u2019s small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) slipped into contractionary territory in Q1 2025 for the first time since Q1 2024, the latest OCBC SME Index report released on Wednesday (Apr 16) indicated.\n\nThe quarterly index, which tracks the business health and performance of SMEs, fell slightly from 50.7 in Q4 2024 to 49.9.\n\nThis follows three consecutive quarters of expansion, which began in Q2 2024. A score above 50 reflects improved business health, while scores below 50 indicate deterioration.\n\nThis downward shift in SME performance is due to a weakening outlook, now exacerbated by tariff-driven global uncertainties, said the lender.\n\nThe report noted that both a slowing of global trade flows and a weaker outlook on the US dollar, will hurt local SMEs in outward-oriented sectors. These include sectors such as information and communications technology (ICT), transport and logistics and wholesale trade.\n\nThese industries posted an average of more than 40 per cent of collections made up by overseas customers, OCBC said, adding that of which 7 per cent are directly received from US-based payers. The lender noted that the collections are mostly denominated in US dollars.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU Friday, 8.30 am SGSME Get updates on Singapore's SME community, along with profiles, news and tips. Sign Up Sign Up\n\nOverall collections grew by 1.7 per cent on year, while payments remained flat with no increase.\n\nOverall, the majority of SME owners surveyed by OCBC did not report a worsened outlook compared with the previous quarter.\n\nAmong the 1,000 business owners surveyed, 41 per cent felt that business conditions were the same, 36 per cent saw improvements, while 23 per cent felt that conditions had worsened.\n\nBusiness owners from the education, retail, and food and beverage sectors had the weakest outlook; almost 3 in 4 owners said that conditions had stayed the same or worsened. In export-oriented industries, more than 60 per cent of owners posted such responses.\n\nAs uncertainty over US President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs continues to dampen the global economic outlook, business owners from the transport and logistics, business services and wholesale trade industries responded that they would be the most affected by geopolitical uncertainties and market competition in the next six months.\n\nExternally oriented industries\n\nSMEs in externally oriented industries experienced contractions in the quarter, the report said.\n\nThe manufacturing sector contracted from 50.5 to 49.8, due to weakness in the precision engineering and consumer products segments. However, SMEs in the electronics and semiconductors segment recorded a \u201chealthy pace of growth\u201d from resilient external demand.\n\nCollections in the sector increased by 37.1 per cent on the year, while payments grew 18.9 per cent, driven by strong overseas growth.\n\nIn the transport and logistics industry, growth retraced from 51.7 in the previous quarter to 49.5. This was due to weakness in the sea transport and land transport segments, which will continue to be affected by weaker trade flows in the upcoming quarter, OCBC said.\n\nThe ICT sector continued its contractionary trend from the previous quarter, falling from 49.4 to 49.2 in Q1 2025. This marked the sector\u2019s eleventh consecutive contractionary quarter, OCBC noted.\n\nThe reading was weighed down particularly by weaker growth in the data processing and software development segment and the IT consultancy segment.\n\nDomestic-facing sectors\n\nNeither were domestic-facing sectors spared. The healthcare sector inched up slightly but remained in contraction, rising to 49.8 from 49.7. Wage concerns continue to face SMEs in this sector, which reported a 15.5 per cent wage bill increase in Q1 2025.\n\nBusiness services dropped 0.4 point to 49.6 in first quarter of 2025, with significant declines in collections (15.1 per cent) and payments (15.9 per cent). The sector was weighed down by weaker growth in the business consultancy segment, which came in at 49.\n\nF&B fell from 51.1 in Q4 2024 to 49.6 in Q1 2025 \u2013 with the largest decline faced by the F&B services segment at 48.3, down from 50.6 in the previous quarter. Meanwhile, F&B wholesale trade SMEs experienced healthy growth, scoring 51.8 on the index.\n\nIn the education sector, SMEs experienced contraction after four consecutive quarters of expansion, with the index falling below 50 to 49.6 for the first time since Q4 2023.\n\nBuilding and construction SMEs inched lower to 49.5 in the first quarter of 2025, from 50.2 in Q4 2024.\n\nDomestic-facing SMEs are likely to experience impact from the tariffs, due to higher costs and inflationary pressures, said OCBC.\n\nThe lender added: \u201cBusinesses may consequently face challenges in maintaining their competitiveness and find themselves operating in a much more cautious business environment.\u201d\n\nHowever, it noted that further regional collaboration, including the integration of Asean economies through initiatives such as the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone, could fuel cross border commerce and new business ventures.\n\nTrends in accessing green financing for sustainable development, as well as the growth of digital trade platforms, could present opportunities for SMEs to capture, the lender said.",

        "content": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday that his state will file a lawsuit challenging U.S. President Donald Trump's authority to impose sweeping tariffs that have set off a global trade war.\n\nThe suit will argue that Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, or a 10 per cent tariff on all imports, is unlawful. The act enables a president to freeze and block transactions in response to foreign threats.\n\nTrump has offered many justifications for increasing tariffs, including that they are designed to spur U.S. manufacturing and stop the flow of illicit fentanyl into the country.\n\nCalifornia's move follows rapidly changing tariff plans by the Trump administration. It is the first state to take legal action over the tariffs, which have been previously legally challenged in suits filed by law firms representing business owners and civil liberties organizations.\n\nNewsom says the tariffs in effect have resulted in inflated costs and billions of dollars in damage in California, which has the largest economy among U.S. states and is a massive exporter.\n\n\"President Trump's unlawful tariffs are wreaking chaos on California families, businesses and our economy \u2014 driving up prices and threatening jobs,\" he said in a statement. \"We're standing up for American families who can't afford to let the chaos continue.\"\n\nAs with Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill, California is arguing that congressional approval was required for the tariffs. Senate Democrats were joined by four Republicans in a symbolic vote rebuking Trump over the tariffs earlier this month, but Trump loyalists lead the House of Representatives, making a similar vote there unlikely.\n\nTrade with Canada impacted\n\nThe state will ask the court to immediately block the tariffs in the lawsuit being filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California,\n\nWATCH l Trump still believes Canada would be a great state, White House says: Trump still wants Canada as 51st state, White House tells CBC News Duration 2:39 Answering a question from CBC News, the White House press secretary said U.S. President Donald Trump still thinks Canada should become the 51st state, but there may be \u2018flexibility\u2019 when it comes to tariffs on Canada's auto sector.\n\nThe announcement on Wednesday comes days after Newsom asked countries to exempt the state's exports from retaliatory tariffs and measures, stating, \"California is not Washington, D.C.\" No deals have yet been announced..\n\nCalifornia, which boasts its economy in terms of gross domestic product is only smaller than a handful of countries, borders Mexico and also enjoys a significant trade relationship with Canada. Trump has expressed grievances about the updated trilateral trade agreement he signed off on in 2019 with Mexico and Canada.\n\nThe Consulate General of Canada estimates that there is $53 billion US of two-way trade annually between Canada and California, and that there are nearly 2,000 Canadian-owned companies operating in the state, with about 90,000 total employees.\n\nCalifornia currently exports about $2 billion more in goods and services to Canada than it imports, the consulate says, but the strained relations as a result of the tariff threats from Washington have seen California wineries and alcohol suppliers punished as a result, with products wiped from the shelves of liquor stores in several provinces.\n\nCalifornia is a farming powerhouse, with many of the nuts, fruits and vegetables the state grows destined for other countries, while it is a significant importer of Canadian petroleum.\n\nNewsom also beckoned Canadians to the Golden State as part of a newly launched tourism campaign.\n\n\"Our inclusive values, love of natural beauty and passion for innovation bind us, and we look forward to welcoming you back with the same community spirit you've always shown us,\" Newsom says in the ad.\n\nWATCH l Canadian travel to the U.S. dips compared to previous year: Canadian travel to U.S. drops by nearly 900,000 in March Duration 2:02 U.S. border data shows that nearly 900,000 fewer people travelled from Canada to the U.S. in March, traditionally a busy month for cross-border travel. The drop has pushed the governor of California to lobby for Canadians to come back to his state.\n\nCalifornia estimates Canadians are the second-biggest international spenders for its tourism economy, with Newsom stating that two million Canadians visited last year. But state tourism officials say visits by Canadians dropped 12 per cent in February compared with the same month last year.\n\nDomestically, the California action stands to mark a resumption of the tensions between the state and the Trump administration. Conflicts dating back to the first Trump administration have arisen over automobile emissions and the environment, reproductive rights and access to abortion, and wildfire prevention and causes.",

        "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump is looming large in the final weeks of Australia's general election campaign, spelling trouble for conservative Opposition leader Peter Dutton just as a new poll shows Australians' faith in the United States at an all-time low.\n\nTrump's blustery style and often disruptive policies, including \"reciprocal\" tariffs against long-time allies and attacks on U.S. government agencies, have begun to alarm Australian voters, analysts and academics say.\n\nThe dynamics are similar but not quite the same as in Canada, where the Liberal Party's fortunes, according to a raft of polls, have been revived dramatically by a change in leadership from Justin Trudeau to Mark Carney ahead of the April 28 vote.\n\nThe Labor Party of Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has surged in various polls relative to Dutton's conservative coalition, with only three-and-a-half weeks until the May 3 election.\n\n\"Trump has emerged as the third candidate in this election campaign,\" said Mark Kenny, a professor specializing in politics at the Australian National University in Canberra.\n\n\"He's made it quite difficult for Peter Dutton to get his message across, and made it difficult for Dutton to be seen as an entirely independent figure in this election campaign.\"\n\nA woman walks past campaign signs depicting candidates in a riding in Lakemba, New South Wales, on March 12. (Hollie Adams/Reuters)\n\nA survey released on Wednesday by the Lowy Institute, a research foundation, found only 36 per cent of Australians expressed any level of trust in the U.S. to act responsibly, down 20 points since the last survey in June 2024 and the lowest since the annual poll was launched two decades ago.\n\nThe polling was conducted in March, before Trump announced his swathe of tariffs, including a blanket 10 per cent on all Australian imports.\n\n\"Given President Donald Trump's norm-shattering approach to his second term, it's no surprise that Australians are less trusting of the United States,\" said Ryan Neelam, the Lowy Institute's Director of Public Opinion and Foreign Policy.\n\nIncumbent tries to tie Dutton to Trump, Musk\n\nDutton, from the Liberal Party has campaigned on several policies seen widely as emulating Trump and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) group, set up by Elon Musk. In January, Dutton appointed Jacinta Nampijinpa Price as a shadow minister for government efficiency, a position inspired by Musk's role, analysts said.\n\n\"With Australians sick of the wasteful spending that is out of control \u2026 Jacinta will be looking closely at how we can achieve a more efficient use of taxpayers' money,\" Dutton said at the time.\n\nThe Labor Party has capitalized on the shift in public sentiment, with Treasurer Jim Chalmers repeatedly referring to the opposition leader as \"DOGE-y Dutton.\"\n\nAlbanese said on Tuesday that Dutton would enact \"DOGE-style cuts\" to the public sector if he were elected.\n\n\"[Australians] are not enjoying the turmoil and the capriciousness of the White House, and Dutton's early enthusiasm along with other conservatives to celebrate Trump's win has been pretty much lead in his saddlebags all the way through this campaign,\" Australian National University's Kenny said.\n\n\"That weight has just got heavier and heavier as Trump has become less and less popular.\"\n\nConsiderable military, intelligence ties\n\nThe combative stance of the new U.S. administration is also a campaign topic in relation to the military co-operation between the two countries.\n\nAustralia has pledged to purchase three nuclear-powered Virginia submarines from the U.S. in the 2030s under the AUKUS trilateral security partnership which also includes the United Kingdom, in an arrangement that contains various plans and contingencies that span decades. The three countries are also, along with Canada and New Zealand, part of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance.\n\nAlbanese is shown with then-U.S. president Joe Biden at an event concerning the AUKUS partnership, at Naval Base Point Loma in San Diego on March 13, 2023. The security arrangement is set to last decades, but has taken on a different cast given the aggressive economic approach, even with allies, of U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. (Leah Millis/Reuters)\n\nThe Australian Submarine Agency said acquiring nuclear submarines was a key part of Australia's defence strategy of denial, and \"will be equipped for intelligence, surveillance, undersea warfare and strike missions.\"\n\nWhile AUKUS has strong support from the major Australian parties, disappointment has been expressed that the defence ties didn't win Australia exemptions from Trump's tariffs has put the program under unprecedented public scrutiny.\n\nIndependent lawmakers are skeptical of Trump and have called for a review of the submarine deal, though the impact of the independents could be limited unless a hung Parliament results from the May 3 vote.\n\nFormer prime minister Scott Morrison, who clinched the AUKUS treaty in 2021, said in an interview with Reuters that the threat posed by China and the deterrent of Australia operating nuclear-powered submarines in the South China Sea and Indian Ocean drove the agreement.\n\n\"China is the threat \u2014 of course they are \u2014 and that is what needs to be deterred,\" Morrison said.\n\n\"The idea of more U.S. and more British boats being in and around Australia, and on station in Australia, in the theatre, we always knew that would bring the earlier deterrent,\" he added.\n\nAustralia's plan to purchase Virginia submarines was added to AUKUS by Labor in 2023.\n\nAlbanese, elected in 2022, has been less willing to publicly criticize China, even as Australia's air force and navy continue freedom of navigation patrols in the South China Sea. This has become a point of political attack in the election campaign for Dutton, who was defence minister in Morrison's government.",

But the activist's lawyer, Esha Bhandari, says the fight is far from over.\n\n\"He's determined to fight this case through to the end and to vindicate the principle that he shouldn't be in a detention centre for his lawful and constitutionally protected speech and his advocacy,\" Bhandari of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) told As It Happens host Nil K\u00f6ksal.\n\nU.S. cites 1952 law to deport pro-Palestinian activists\n\nBorn in a Palestinian refugee camp in Syria, Khalil came to the U.S. on a student visa in 2022, and became a U.S. permanent resident last year. His wife, Noor Abdalla, is a U.S. citizen.\n\nHe completed a master's degree in public administration in December 2024 and was set to graduate in May. But those plans were disrupted when ICE officers came to his home at his university-owned apartment in New York City on March 8 and arrested him.\n\nHe was first held in New Jersey, then sent to a privately-owned immigration detention centre in Louisiana, where he has remained ever since.\n\nHe has not been charged with any crimes. Rather, his detention is based on his prominent role in the Columbia student protests against Israel's military campaign in Gaza.\n\nWATCH | Judge says Mahmoud Khalil's deportation case can proceed: U.S. judge rules Columbia student, activist Mahmoud Khalil can be deported Duration 1:58 A U.S. judge has ruled Columbia University graduate student and pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil can be deported as a national security risk. Khalil was the first arrest under the Trump administration\u2019s promised crackdown on campus protests.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio said last month that Khalil should be removed from the U.S. because his presence in the United States has \"potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences,\" citing a 1952 law called the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\nIn a two-page letter submitted to the court and Khalil's lawyers, which they shared with reporters, Rubio wrote that Khalil should be removed for his role in \"antisemitic protests and disruptive activities, which fosters a hostile environment for Jewish students in the United States.\"\n\nBhandari says the government has not defined what type of speech falls under the scope of this law.\n\n\"That is a very troubling, chilling position to take, and there's no reason it would be limited to this particular issue,\" she said.\n\n\"The government could decide tomorrow that anyone who spoke out about the war in Ukraine in a way that it didn't like is now subject to the same law and can be detained. They could make the same argument about climate change.\"\n\nOther activists detained, threatened with deportation\n\nKhalil, she says, has garnered an outpouring of support from across the country that gives him strength to carry on.\n\nNevertheless, she says he should not have been taken from his home while he's expecting his first child, and sent 1,930 kilometres away to a facility in another state.\n\n\"Their personal circumstances are very important, but, of course, Mahmoud's not the only person being held behind bars at the moment for engaging in perfectly lawful speech,\" Bhandari said.\n\nDemonstrators gather in New York City on Saturday to demand Khalil's release. (David Dee Delgado/Getty Images)\n\nOn Monday, ICE detained Palestinian Mohsen Mahdawi \u2014 one of Khalil's friends and a fellow Columbia protester \u2014 at a Vermont immigration office where he had expected to be interviewed about finalizing his U.S. citizenship.\n\nRumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish student at Tufts University in Massachusetts, was arrested by masked and plainclothes agents in March , roughly a year after she co-authored an opinion piece in a student paper calling on the university to divest from companies with ties to Israel and to \"acknowledge the Palestinian genocide.\"\n\nColumbia's Yunseo Chung, a Korean American who has lived in the U.S. since she was seven, is fighting the Trump administration's attempts to have her deported after she participated in pro-Palestinian protests.\n\nWATCH | PhD student arrested by masked U.S. immigration agents: Tufts University PhD student arrested by masked ICE agents Duration 2:01 Tufts University PhD student Rumeysa Ozturk was arrested by masked U.S. immigration agents near Boston. The Trump administration is revoking her student visa, accusing the Turkish national of engaging in pro-Hamas activities.\n\nIt's not clear how many student activists are in immigration detention, but when asked about Ozturk's case, Rubio told reporters he's revoked nearly 300 visas from \"lunatics that are tearing things up.\"\n\nBhandari says this is \"no ordinary immigration enforcement.\"\n\n\"Nothing about this is normal,\" she said. \"This is a program of censorship using immigration law to achieve its ends.\"\n\nShe says it's one of several tools the administration is deploying, including investigating private law firms , and witholding funds from universities that fall afoul of Trump's agenda.\n\nIn Canada, Conservative Leader Pierre Poillievre vowed in a recent campaign stop to end the \"woke influence in federal support for university research.\"\n\nBhandari says the ACLU is asking a federal court to deem Khlalil's detention, and the government's use of the Immigration and Nationality Act, unlawful and unconstitutional.\n\nIn a separate case in a New Jersey federal court, Khalil is challenging his arrest, detention and transfer to Louisiana.\n\nWhile the Trump administration has flouted court orders before \u2014 most recently one from the U.S. Supreme Court to facilitate the return of a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador \u2014 Bhandari remains hopeful.\n\n\"We would fully expect that if any court orders the release of either Ms. Ozturk, Mr. Khalil, or anyone else that's currently in a detention facility, that the government will abide by that, as they have to,\" Bhandari said.",

Yet the Fed is unlikely to intervene unless there is a breakdown in the market for Treasury securities or other malfunctions, economists say.\n\nIn written remarks to be delivered to the Economic Club of Chicago, Powell reiterated that the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs are \u201csignificantly larger than anticipated.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cThe same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\u201d he said.\n\n4:49 Bank of Canada pauses further interest rate cuts amid ongoing U.S. trade tensions\n\nPowell said the inflation will likely be temporary, but \u201ccould also be more persistent,\u201d echoing a concern expressed by a majority of the Fed\u2019s 19-member interest rate-setting committee in the minutes of their meeting last month.\n\nGet daily National news Get the day's top news, political, economic, and current affairs headlines, delivered to your inbox once a day.

On Monday, Fed governor Christopher Waller said that he expects the impact of even a large increase in tariffs to be temporary, even if they are left in place for several years. At the same time, he also expects such large duties would weigh on the economy and even threaten a recession.\n\nShould the economy slow sharply, even if inflation remained elevated, Waller said he would support cutting interest rates \u201csooner, and to a greater extent than I had previously thought.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nBut other Fed officials, including Neel Kashkari, president of the Fed\u2019s Minneapolis branch, have said they are more focused on fighting the effects of higher tariffs on inflation, suggesting they are less likely to support rate cuts anytime soon.\n\nFor now, most recent reports suggest the economy is in solid shape. Hiring has been solid and inflation cooled in March. Yet measures of consumer and business confidence have plunged, raising concerns among economists that spending and business investment could weaken.",
